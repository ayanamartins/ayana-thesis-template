  In recent years, strikingly consistent patterns of biodiversity have been
  identified over space, time, organism type and geographical region. A neutral
  theory (assuming no environmental selection or organismal interactions) has
  been shown to predict many patterns of ecological biodiversity. This theory
  is based on a mechanism by which new species arise similarly to point
  mutations in a population without sexual reproduction. Here we report the
  simulation of populations with sexual reproduction, mutation and dispersal.
  We found simulated time dependence of speciation rates, speciesâ€“area
  relationships and species abundance distributions consistent with the
  behaviours found in nature. From our results, we predict steady speciation
  rates, more species in one-dimensional environments than two-dimensional
  environments, three scaling regimes of speciesâ€“area relationships and
  lognormal distributions of species abundance with an excess of rare species
  and a tail that may be approximated by Fisher's logarithmic series. These are
  consistent with dependences reported for, among others, global birds and
  flowering plants, marine invertebrate fossils, ray-finned fishes, British
  birds and moths, North American songbirds, mammal fossils from Kansas and
  Panamanian shrubs. Quantitative comparisons of specific cases are remarkably
  successful. Our biodiversity results provide additional evidence that species
  diversity arises without specific physical barriers. This is similar to heavy
  traffic flows, where traffic jams can form even without accidents or
  barriers.%

  In population genetics, the Moran model describes the neutral evolution of a
  biallelic gene in a population of haploid individuals subjected to mutations.
  We show in this paper that this model can be mapped into an influence
  dynamical process on networks subjected to external influences. The panmictic
  case considered by Moran corresponds to fully connected networks and can be
  completely solved in terms of hypergeometric functions. Other types of
  networks correspond to structured populations, for which approximate
  solutions are also available. This approach to the classic Moran model leads
  to a relation between regular networks based on spatial grids and the
  mechanism of isolation by distance. We discuss the consequences of this
  connection for topopatric speciation and the theory of neutral speciation and
  biodiversity. We show that the effect of mutations in structured populations,
  where individuals can mate only with neighbors, is greatly enhanced with
  respect to the panmictic case. If mating is further constrained by genetic
  proximity between individuals, a balance of opposing tendencies takes place:
  increasing diversity promoted by enhanced effective mutations versus
  decreasing diversity promoted by similarity between mates. Resolution of
  large enough opposing tendencies occurs through speciation via pattern
  formation. We derive an explicit expression that indicates when speciation is
  possible involving the parameters characterizing the population. We also show
  that the time to speciation is greatly reduced in comparison with the
  panmictic case.%

  We investigate an individual-based model of adaptive radiation based on the
  biogeographical changes of the Great African Lakes where cichlid fishes
  radiated. In our model, the landscape consists of a mosaic of three habitat
  types which may or may not be separated by geographic barriers. We study the
  effect of the alternation between allopatry and sympatry called landscape
  dynamics. We show that landscape dynamics can generate a significantly higher
  diversity than allopatric or sympatric speciation alone. Diversification is
  mainly due to the joint action of allopatric, ecological divergence, and of
  disruptive selection increasing assortative mating and allowing for the
  coexistence in sympatry of species following reinforcement or character
  displacement. Landscape dynamics possibly increase diversity at each
  landscape change. The characteristics of the radiation depend on the speed of
  landscape dynamics and of the number of geographically isolated regions at
  steady state. Under fast dynamics of a landscape with many fragments, the
  model predicts a high diversity, possibly subject to the temporary collapse
  of all species into a hybrid swarm. When fast landscape dynamics induce the
  recurrent fusion of several sites, diversity is moderate but very stable over
  time. Under slow landscape dynamics, diversification proceeds similarly,
  although at a slower pace.%

  Ring species provide particularly clear demonstrations of how one species can
  gradually evolve into two, but are rare in nature. In the greenish warbler
  (Phylloscopus trochiloides) species complex, a ring of populations wraps
  around Tibet. Two reproductively isolated forms co-exist in central Siberia,
  with a gradient of genetic and phenotypic characteristics through the
  southern chain of populations connecting them. Previous genetic evidence has
  proven inconclusive, however, regarding whether species divergence took place
  in the face of continuous gene flow and whether hybridization between the
  terminal forms of the ring ever occurred. Here we use genome-wide analyses to
  show that, although spatial patterns of genetic variation are currently
  mostly as expected of a ring species, historical breaks in gene flow have
  existed at more than one location around the ring, and the two Siberian forms
  have occasionally interbred. Substantial periods of geographical isolation
  occurred not only in the north but also in the western Himalayas, where there
  is now an extensive hybrid zone between genetically divergent forms. Limited
  asymmetric introgression has occurred directly between the Siberian forms,
  although it has not caused a blending of those forms, suggesting selection
  against introgressed genes in the novel genetic background. Levels of
  reproductive isolation and genetic introgression are consistent with levels
  of phenotypic divergence around the ring, with phenotypic similarity and
  extensive interbreeding across the southwestern contact zone and strong
  phenotypic divergence and nearly complete reproductive isolation across the
  northern contact zone. These results cast doubt on the hypothesis that the
  greenish warbler should be viewed as a rare example of speciation by
  distance, but demonstrate that the greenish warbler displays a continuum from
  slightly divergent neighbouring populations to almost fully reproductively
  isolated species.%

  Abstract The analysis of interactions between lineages at varying levels of
  genetic divergence can provide into the process of speiation through the
  accumulation of incompatiable mutations. Ring species, and especially the
  Ensatina eschscholtzii system exemplify this approach. The plethodontid
  salamanders E. eschscholtzii xanthoptica and E. eschscholtzii platensis
  hybridize in the central Sierran foothills of California. We compared the
  genetic structure across two transects (southern and northern Calaveras Co.),
  one of which was resampled over 20 years, and examined diagnostic molecular
  markers (eight allozyme loci and mitochondrial {DNA}) and a diagnostic
  quantitative trait (color pattern). Key results across all studies were: (1)
  cline centers for all markers were coincident and the zones were narrow, with
  width estimates of 730 m to 2000 m; (2) cline centers at the northern
  Calveras transect were coincident between 1981 and 2001, demonstrating
  repeatability over five generations; (3) there were very few if any putative
  F1S, but a relatively high number of backcrossed individuals in the central
  portion of transects; and (4) we found substantial linkage disequilibrium in
  all three studies and strong heterozygote deficit both in northern Calaveras,
  in 2001, and southern Calaveras. Both linkage disequilibrium and heterozygote
  deficit showed maximum values near the center of the zones. Using estimates
  of cline width and dispersal, we infer strong selection against hybrids. This
  is sufficient to promote accumulation of differences at loci that are neutral
  or under divergent selection, but would still allow for introgression of
  adaptive alleles. The evidence for strong but incomplete isolation across
  this centrally located contact is consistent with theory suggesting a gradual
  increase in postzygotic incompatibility between allopatric populations
  subject to divergent selection and reinforces the value of Ensatina as a
  system for the study of divergence and speciation at multiple stages.%

  The existing theory of sympatric speciation assumes that a local population
  splits into two species under one-dimensional disruptive selection, which
  favors both of the opposite extreme values of a quantitative trait. Here we
  model sympatric speciation under selection that favors high values of either
  of the two independently inherited traits, each required to efficiently
  consume one of the two available resources, but acts, because of a tradeoff,
  against those possessing high values of both traits. Such two-dimensional
  incompatibility selection is similar to that involved in allopatric
  speciation. Using a hypergeometric phenotypic model, we show that
  incompatibility selection readily leads to sympatric speciation. In contrast
  to disruptive selection, two distinct modes of sympatric speciation exist
  under incompatibility selection: under strong tradeoffs both of the new
  species are specialists, each consuming its own resource, but under moderate
  tradeoffs speciation may be asymmetric and involve the origin of a specialist
  and a generalist species. Also, incompatibility selection may lead to
  irreversible specialization: under strong tradeoffs, the population speciates
  if it consists mostly of unspecialized individuals, but remains undivided if
  most of the individuals are specialized to consume one of the resources.
  Incompatibility selection appears to be more realistic than disruptive
  selection, implying that incompatibility between individually adaptive
  alleles or trait states drives both allopatric and sympatric speciation.%

  Ring species are a biological complex that theoretically forms when an
  ancestral population extends its range around a geographic barrier and,
  despite low-level gene flow, differentiates until reproductive isolation
  exists when terminal populations come into secondary contact. Due to their
  rarity in nature, little is known about the biological factors that promote
  the formation of ring species. We use evolutionary algorithms operating on
  two simple computational problems ({SAW} and K-max) to study the process of
  speciation under the conditions which may yield ring species. We vary
  evolutionary parameters to measure their influence on ring speciesâ€™
  development and stability over evolutionary time. Using the {SAW} problem,
  ring species consistently form, i.e. fertility is negatively correlated with
  distance (R-values between âˆ’0.097 and âˆ’0.821, p\&lt;0.001), and terminal
  populations show substantial infertility. However, all {SAW} simulations
  demonstrate instability in the complex after sympatric zones are established
  between terminal populations. Higher mutation rates and larger
  dispersal/breeding radii promote ring speciesâ€™ formation and stability.
  Using a problem with a simple fitness landscape, the K-max problem, ring
  species do not form. Instead, speciation around the ring occurs before ring
  closure as good genotypes become locally dominant.%

  Neutral speciation mechanisms based on isolation by distance and assortative
  mating, termed topopatric, has recently been shown to describe the observed
  patterns of abundance distributions and speciesâ€“area relationships.
  Previous works have considered this type of process only in the context of
  hermaphroditic populations. In this work, we extend a hermaphroditic model of
  topopatric speciation to populations where individuals are explicitly
  separated into males and females. We show that for a particular carrying
  capacity, speciation occurs under similar conditions, but the number of
  species generated is lower than in the hermaphroditic case. As a consequence,
  the speciesâ€“area curve has lower exponents, especially at intermediate
  scales. Evolution results in fewer species having more abundant populations.%

  Abstract The branching of new species from an ancestral population requires
  the evolution of reproductive isolation between groups of individuals.
  Geographic separation of sub-populations by natural barriers, if sustained
  for sufficiently long times, may lead to the accumulation of independent
  genetic changes in each group and to mating incompatibilities (Mayr, 2001;
  Fitzpatrick et al., 2009). A similar phenomenon may occur in the absence of
  barriers via isolation by distance if the population is distributed over
  large areas (de Aguiar et al., 2009; Etienne and Haegeman, 2011; Gavrilets et
  al., 2000). The first demonstration of this process was based on computer
  simulations employing agent-based models. Recently, analytical results were
  derived combining network theory, to model the spatial structure of the
  population, and an ansatz that accounts for the effect of forbidding mating
  between individuals that are too different genetically (de Aguiar and
  Bar-Yam, 2011). The main result obtained with this approach is an expression
  that indicates when speciation is possible as a function of the parameters
  describing the population. The aim of this work is to test this analytical
  result by comparing it with numerical simulations for a hermaphroditic
  population (de Aguiar et al., 2009) and for a population whose individuals
  are explicitly separated into males and females (Baptestini et al., 2013). We
  show that the analytical formula is indeed a very good overall description of
  the simulations and that the exponents describing dependence of the critical
  threshold of speciation with the parameters are in good agreement with the
  simulations.%

  The circular distribution of the willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus around
  the Baltic Sea shares many features with the classic examples of ring
  species; however, the system is much younger. It has previously been shown
  that a secondary contact zone is located in central Scandinavia, where there
  are narrow clines for several morphological traits coincident with a
  migratory divide. Here we analyse multiple traits and genes
  fromÂ {\textgreater}Â 1700 males captured on breeding territories at 77 sites
  spread around the Baltic Sea to test the following hypothesis. If the
  secondary contact zone in Scandinavia is a result of divergence in two
  allopatric refuge populations during the last glaciation, we expect to find a
  similar secondary contact zone somewhere else around the circular
  distribution. Our results show that the trait clines were wider and displaced
  from each other along the eastern side of the Baltic Sea. Analyses of 12
  microsatellite loci confirmed that the genome is very similar between the
  terminal forms ({FST}Â =Â 0). Two {AFLP}-derived markers filtered out from a
  genomic scan instead appear to be maintained by selection. These markers
  exhibited steep clines at the secondary contact zone in Scandinavia, but as
  for the phenotypic traits, had vastly different cline centres east of the
  Baltic Sea. The trait clines along the ring distribution outside the
  Scandinavian secondary contact zone thus seem to have been shaped by
  independent action of selection or drift during the process of postglacial
  colonization.%

  A scientific symposium on landscape genetics, held at the 2013 {IALE} Europe
  Conference in Manchester {UK} (September 2â€“8, 2013), highlighted status,
  challenges and future avenues in the field. Key topics included analytical
  aspects in landscape genetics, conceptual progress and application of
  landscape genetics for conservation management. First, analytical aspects
  referred to statistical relationships between genetic and landscape data. It
  was suggested that linear mixed models or Bayesian approaches are
  particularly promising due to more appropriate and powerful ways for
  analyzing landscape effects on genetic variation. Second, supplementing
  neutral genetic variation with adaptive genetic variation is very promising.
  However, research needs to go beyond the identification of genomic regions
  under selection and provide information on the ecological function of
  adaptive genetic regions. Conceptually, endogenous processes (e.g.,
  life-history attributes such as dispersal) require consideration as
  supplementary factors in shaping the genetic variation in addition to
  landscapes. Also, the temporal dimension in landscapes for both the past and
  the future should be given increased attention as the genetic responses to
  landscape change may be non-simultaneous, resulting in time lags. As for
  applied conservation management, landscape genetics can provide important
  baseline information such as basic data on species movement in a spatial
  context, assessments of the spatial need for management efforts, or
  evaluations of the effectiveness of already existing management measures.%

  There are nine named species of buckeye butterflies (genus Junonia HÃ¼bner)
  in the Western Hemisphere. There is considerable geographic variation within
  Junonia species, and possible ongoing hybridization between species,
  suggesting that Junonia may be a ring species, but also making this a very
  difficult group to define taxonomically. We tried to determine whether two
  forms of Junonia from ArgentinaÂ â€“Â conventionally referred to as Junonia
  genoveva hilaris C. \& R. Felder, the light buckeye butterfly, and Junonia
  evarete flirtea (Fabricius), the dark buckeye butterflyÂ â€“Â were
  genetically distinct species or simply colour forms of a single species using
  morphological characters, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I ({COI}) {DNA}
  barcodes, nuclear wingless (wg) locus {DNA} sequences, and anonymous nuclear
  Randomly Amplified Fingerprints ({RAF}). Phylogenetic analysis of {COI}
  identified two distinct mitochondrial haplotypes that differ by about 4\%
  sequence divergence; one confined to light-coloured Junonia specimens and one
  shared between some light-coloured Junonia and all of dark-coloured Junonia
  specimens. Analysis of nuclear wingless sequences revealed 32 alleles among
  22 Junonia specimens and showed significant genetic differentiation between
  light-coloured and dark-coloured Junonia. Analysis of {RAF} genotypes
  suggests that there are actually three genetically distinct Junonia
  populations in Argentina: two with light wing coloration, and one with dark
  wing coloration. Genetic evidence of recent hybridization among these
  populations was also observed, consistent with the ring species hypothesis.
  Careful comparisons of morphological characters between Argentinian Junonia
  and Junonia species from elsewhere in South America suggests that the two
  light-coloured populations correspond to J.â€‰genoveva and either a
  genetically disparate population of the same species or an undescribed
  cryptic Junonia species, The dark-coloured population may correspond to
  J.â€‰wahlbergi BrÃ©vignon. Our data suggest that {COI} {DNA} barcodes by
  themselves are not very useful for studying Junonia taxonomy, population
  structure or evolution.%

  Abstract.â€” The distribution of circumtropical marine species is limited by
  continental boundaries, cold temperate conditions, and oceanic expanses, but
  some of these barriers are permeable over evolutionary time scales. Sister
  taxa that evolved in separate ocean basins can come back into contact, and
  the consequences of this renewed sympatry may be a key to understanding
  evolutionary processes in marine organisms. The circumtropical trumpetfishes
  (Aulostomus) include a West Atlantic species (A. maculatus), an
  Indian-Pacific species (A. chinensis), and an East Atlantic species (A.
  strigosus) that may be the product of a recent invasion from the Indian
  Ocean. To resolve patterns of divergence and speciation, we surveyed 480 bp
  of mitochondrial {DNA} cytochrome b in 196 individuals from 16 locations.
  Based on a conventional molecular clock of 2\% sequence divergence per
  million years, the deepest partitions in a neighbor-joining tree (d=
  0.063-0.082) are consistent with separation of West Atlantic and
  Indian-Pacific species by the Isthmus of Panama, 3â€“4 million years ago. By
  the same criteria, trumpetfish in the East Atlantic were isolated from the
  Indian Ocean about 2.5 million years ago (d= 0.044-0.054), coincident with
  the advent of glacial cycles and cold-water upwelling around South Africa.
  Continental barriers between tropical oceans have only rarely been surmounted
  by trumpetfishes, but oceanic barriers do not appear to be substantial, as
  indicated by weak population partitioning (Ã¸{ST}= 0.093) in A. chinensis
  across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Finally, morphological and
  mitochondrial {DNA} data indicate hybridization of A. strigosus and A.
  maculatus in Brazil. After 3â€“4 million years and a globe-spanning series of
  vicariant and dispersal events, trumpetfish lineages have come back into
  contact in the southwest Atlantic and appear to be merging. This ring species
  phenomenon may occur in a broad array of marine organisms, with clear
  implications for the production and maintenance of biodiversity in marine
  ecosystems.%

  The Dobzhansky-Muller model proposes that hybrid incompatibilities are caused

  has functionally diverged in Drosophila simulans and interacts with Hybrid
  male rescue (Hmr), which has functionally diverged in D. melanogaster, to
  cause lethality in F1 hybrid males. {LHR} localizes to heterochromatic

  A unique and comprehensive text on the philosophy of model-based data
  analysis and strategy for the analysis of empirical data. The book introduces
  information theoretic approaches and focuses critical attention on a priori
  modeling and the selection of a good approximating model that best represents
  the inference supported by the data. It contains several new approaches to
  estimating model selection uncertainty and incorporating selection
  uncertainty into estimates of precision. An array of examples is given to
  illustrate various technical issues. The text has been written for biologists
  and statisticians using models for making inferences from empirical data.%

  Numerous studies have aimed at assessing the relationships between (i)
  distances computed from phenotypic data, (ii) distances computed from marker
  data and (iii) heterosis, for pairs of individuals or populations. The
  conflicting results obtained illustrate that these relationships are far from
  simple. In this paper, we investigate the effect on these relationships of
  (i) the polygenic inheritance of phenotypic traits and (ii) the structure of
  linkage disequilibrium between genetic markers and the loci involved in the
  variation of quantitative traits ({QTLs}). Both theoretical and experimental
  results showed that the relationship between marker distances and phenotypic
  distances computed from quantitative traits displays a triangular shape: low
  marker distances are systematically associated with low phenotypic distances,
  whereas high marker distances correspond to either low or high phenotypic
  distances. Because of this property, the linear coefficient of correlation
  between both distances decreases as the number of {QTLs} involved in the
  variation of the traits considered for phenotypic distance computation
  increases. Similar properties are expected for the relationship between
  heterosis and phenotypic distances.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The most common classification of modes of speciation begins with the spatial
  context in which divergence occurs: sympatric, parapatric or allopatric. This
  classification is unsatisfactory because it divides a continuum into discrete
  categories, concentrating attention on the extremes, and it subordinates
  other dimensions on which speciation processes vary, such as the forces
  driving differentiation and the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. It
  also ignores the fact that speciation is a prolonged process that commonly
  has phases in different spatial contexts. We use the example of local
  adaptation and partial reproductive isolation in the intertidal gastropod
  Littorina saxatilis to illustrate the inadequacy of the spatial
  classification of speciation modes. Parallel divergence in shell form in
  response to similar environmental gradients in England, Spain and Sweden
  makes this an excellent model system. However, attempts to demonstrate
  â€˜incipientâ€™ and â€˜sympatricâ€™ speciation involve speculation about the
  future and the past. We suggest that it is more productive to study the
  current balance between local adaptation and gene flow, the interaction
  between components of reproductive isolation and the genetic basis of
  differentiation.%

  A ring species arises when a parental population expands around an area of
  unsuitable habitat in such a way that when the two fronts meet they behave as
  distinct species while still being connected through a series of intergrading
  populations. Ring species offer great possibilities for studying the forces
  causing species divergence (e.g. the nature of pre-zygotic or post-zygotic
  reproductive isolation) or helping to maintain species integrity (e.g.
  reinforcement). Yet, ring species are extremely rare, and have only been
  documented convincingly in animals. Here, we present phylogenetic analyses of
  two nuclear gene regions from the Caribbean slipper spurge (Euphorbia
  tithymaloides) species complex that provide evidence that this group forms a
  ring species. These data show that the species complex originated in the area
  where Mexico and Guatemala meet, and expanded around the Caribbean basin
  along two distinct fronts: one eastward through the Yucatan Peninsula and
  into the Greater Antilles ({GA}); one southeastward through northern South
  America and then northward to the Lesser Antilles and eastern {GA}. The two
  terminal forms co-occur in the Virgin Islands and appear to be
  morphologically and ecologically distinct. Thus, our results suggest that
  Euphorbia tithymaloides is the first compelling example of a ring species in
  plants.%

  In recent years, we are seeing the formulation and use of elaborate and

  systematic and error-proof exploration of parameter spaces are of great
  importance to better understand, estimate confidences and make use of the
  output from these models. In this work, we investigate some of the relevant
  questions related to parameter space exploration, in particular using the
  technique known as Latin Hypercube Sampling and focusing in quantitative
  output analysis. We present the analysis of a structured population growth
  model and contrast our findings with results from previously used techniques,

  Abstract.â€” Recent models of speciation have incorporated population
  structure and migration into the classic model of speciation in which
  reproductive isolation arises as a by-product of divergence. In this paper,
  we expanded these models to explore the joint effects of migration and
  population subdivision on speciation in a spatially explicit context. The
  results of our simulation support previous results concerning the influence
  of population subdivision on the accumulation of reproductive isolation. The
  simulation also shows that speciation in subdivided populations occurs most
  rapidly when subpopulations are not strictly allopatric. These results
  counter the widespread notion that speciation is most likely to occur in
  allopatric populations and suggest that there are useful insights to be
  gained by incorporating increasingly realistic types of population structure
  into models of speciation.%

  Mate choice by phenotype matching, whereby individuals prefer a mate whose
  phenotype is similar to their own, should facilitate speciation with gene
  flow. This is because the genes that control mate signal (the phenotype being
  matched) also determine the preferred mate signal (â€œmate preferenceâ€).
  Speciation is made even easier if phenotype matching is based on a trait
  under divergent natural selection. In this case, assortative mating should
  readily evolve as a byproduct of divergent selection on the trait. Previous
  observational studies of assortative mating between sympatric, hybridizing
  threespine stickleback species (Gasterosteus aculeatus complex) suggested
  that phenotype matching might occur by body size, a trait under divergent
  natural selection. To test this, we used experimental manipulation of body
  size to rule out the effects of confounding variables. We found that
  size-manipulated benthic and limnetic stickleback females prefer mates whose
  body size more closely matches their own. It is thus likely that assortative
  mating by phenotype matching has facilitated the origin and persistence of
  benthic and limnetic threespine sticklebacks in the face of gene flow.%

  difference-equation models. Inclusion of such variation is important for
  continued progress in ecological and evolutionary theory. We provide a
  conceptual basis for {IBMs} by describing five major types of individual
  variation in {IBMs}: spatial, ontogenetic, phenotypic, cognitive, and
  genetic. {IBMs} are now used in almost all subfields of ecology and
  evolutionary biology. We map those subfields and look more closely at
  selected key papers on fish recruitment, forest dynamics, sympatric
  speciation, metapopulation dynamics, maintenance of diversity, and species
  conservation. Theorists are currently divided on whether {IBMs} represent
  only a practical tool for extending classical theory to more complex
  situations, or whether individual-based theory represents a radically new
  research program. We feel that the tension between these two poles of
  thinking can be a source of creativity in ecology and evolutionary theory.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The role of mutation rate in optimizing key features of evolutionary dynamics
  has recently been investigated in various computational models. Here, we
  address the related question of how maximum mutation size affects the
  formation of species in a simple computational evolutionary model. We find
  that the number of species is maximized for intermediate values of a mutation
  size parameter Î¼; the result is observed for evolving organisms on a
  randomly changing landscape as well as in a version of the model where
  negative feedback exists between the local population size and the fitness
  provided by the landscape. The same result is observed for various
  distributions of mutation values within the limits set by Î¼. When organisms
  with various values of Î¼ compete against each other, those with intermediate
  Î¼ values are found to survive. The surviving values of Î¼ from these
  competition simulations, however, do not necessarily coincide with the values
  that maximize the number of species. These results suggest that various
  complex factors are involved in determining optimal mutation parameters for
  any population, and may also suggest approaches for building a computational
  bridge between the (micro) dynamics of mutations at the level of individual
  organisms and (macro) evolutionary dynamics at the species level.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed
  that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species
  arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species.
  In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species
  arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly
  because of theoretical difficulties,. Most previous models analysing
  sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while
  neglecting others. Here we present a model that integrates a novel
  combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a
  likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to
  describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider
  the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially
  with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting
  resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases,
  evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between
  ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a
  marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition,
  speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between
  the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting
  empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Adaptive speciation occurs when frequency-dependent ecological interactions
  generate conditions of disruptive selection to which lineage splitting is an
  adaptive response. Under such selective conditions, evolution of assortative
  mating mechanisms enables the break-up of the ancestral lineage into
  diverging and reproductively isolated descendent species. Extending previous
  studies, I investigate models of adaptive speciation due to the evolution of
  indirect assortative mating that is based on three different mating traits:
  the degree of assortativity, a female preference trait and a male marker
  trait. For speciation to occur, linkage disequilibria between different
  mating traits, e.g. between female preference and male marker traits, as well
  as between mating traits and the ecological trait, must evolve. This can lead
  to novel speciation scenarios, e.g. when reproductive isolation is generated
  by a splitting in the degree of assortativeness, with one of the emerging
  lineages mating assortatively, and the other one disassortatively. I
  investigate the effects of variation in various model parameters on the
  likelihood of speciation, as well as robustness of speciation to introducing
  costs of assortative mating. Even though in the models presented speciation
  requires the genetic potential for strong assortment as well as rather
  restrictive ecological conditions, the results show that adaptive speciation
  due to the evolution of assortative mating when mate choice is based on
  separate female preference and male marker traits is a theoretically
  plausible evolutionary scenario.%

  We consider and compare four approaches to modeling the dynamics of spatially
  distributed systems: mean field approaches (described by ordinary
  differential equations) in which every individual is considered to have equal
  probability of interacting with every other individual; patch models that
  group discrete individuals into patches without additional spatial structure;
  reaction-diffusion equations, in which infinitesimal individuals are
  distributed in space; and interacting particle systems, in which individuals
  are discrete and space is treated explicitly. We apply these four approaches
  to three examples of species interactions in spatially distributed
  populations and compare their predictions. Each represents different
  assumptions about the biology and hence a comparison among them has
  biological as well as modeling implications. In the first case all four
  approaches agree, in the second the spatial models disagree with the
  nonspatial ones, while in the third the stochastic models with discrete
  individuals disagree with the ones based on differential equations. We show
  further that the limiting reaction-diffusion equations associated with
  particle systems can have different qualitative behavior from those obtained
  by simply adding diffusion terms to mean field equations.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Population genetics theory is primarily based on mathematical models in which
  spatial complexity and temporal variability are largely ignored. In contrast,
  the field of landscape genetics expressly focuses on how population genetic
  processes are affected by complex spatial and temporal environmental
  heterogeneity. It is spatially explicit and relates patterns to processes by
  combining complex and realistic life histories, behaviours, landscape
  features and genetic data. Central to landscape genetics is the connection of
  spatial patterns of genetic variation to the usually highly stochastic
  spaceâ€“time processes that create them over both historical and contemporary
  time periods. The field should benefit from a shift to computer simulation
  approaches, which enable incorporation of demographic and environmental
  stochasticity. A key role of simulations is to show how demographic processes
  such as dispersal or reproduction interact with landscape features to affect
  probability of site occupancy, population size, and gene flow, which in turn
  determine spatial genetic structure. Simulations could also be used to
  compare various statistical methods and determine which have correct type I
  error or the highest statistical power to correctly identify spatio-temporal
  and environmental effects. Simulations may also help in evaluating how
  specific spatial metrics may be used to project future genetic trends. This
  article summarizes some of the fundamental aspects of spatialâ€“temporal
  population genetic processes. It discusses the potential use of simulations
  to determine how various spatial metrics can be rigorously employed to
  identify features of interest, including contrasting locus-specific spatial
  patterns due to micro-scale environmental selection.%

  We carried out a three-tiered genetic analysis of egg-to-adult development
  time and viability in ancestral and derived populations of cactophilic
  Drosophila mojavensis to test the hypothesis that evolution of these
  life-history characters has shaped premating reproductive isolation in this
  species. First, a common garden experiment with 11 populations from Baja
  California and mainland Mexico and Arizona reared on two host species
  revealed significant host plant X region and population interactions for
  viability and development time, evidence for host plant adaptation. Second,
  replicated line crosses with flies reared on both hosts revealed autosomal, X
  chromosome, cytoplasmic, and autosome X cactus influences on development
  time. Viability differences were influenced by host plants, autosomal
  dominance, and X chromosomal effects. Many of the F1, F2, and backcross
  generations showed evidence of heterosis for viability. Third, a {QTL}
  analysis of male courtship song and epicuticular hydrocarbon variation based
  on 1688 Baja Ã— mainland F2 males also revealed eight {QTL} influencing
  development time differences. Mainland alleles at six of these loci were
  associated with longer development times, consistent with population-level
  differences. Eight G Ã— E interactions were also detected caused by longer
  development times of mainland alleles expressed on a mainland host with
  smaller differences among Baja genotypes reared on the Baja host plant. Four
  {QTL} influenced both development time and epicuticular hydrocarbon
  differences associated with courtship success, and there was a significant
  {QTL}-based correlation between development time and cuticular hydrocarbon
  variation. Thus, the regional shifts in life histories that evolved once D.
  mojavensis invaded mainland Mexico from Baja California by shifting host
  plants were genetically correlated with variation in cuticular
  hydrocarbon-based mate preferences.%

  Recent studies have shown that low-frequency alleles can sometimes surf on
  the wave of advance of a population range expansion, reaching high
  frequencies and spreading over large areas. Using microbial populations,
  Hallatschek and colleagues have provided the first experimental evidence of
  surfing during spatial expansions. They also show that the newly colonized
  area should become structured into sectors of low genetic diversity separated
  by sharp allele frequency gradients, increasing the global genetic
  differentiation of the population. These experimental results can be easily
  reproduced in silico and they should apply to a wide variety of higher
  organisms. They also suggest that a single range expansion can create very
  complex patterns at neutral loci, mimicking adaptive processes and resembling
  postglacial segregation of clades from distinct refuge areas.%

  The tradition of classifying cases of speciation into discrete geographic
  categories (allopatric, parapatric and sympatric) fuelled decades of fruitful
  research and debate. Not surprisingly, as the science has become more
  sophisticated, this simplistic taxonomy has become increasingly obsolete.
  Geographic patterns are now reasonably well understood. Sister species are
  rarely sympatric, implying that sympatric speciation, it its most general
  sense, is rare. However, sympatric speciation, even in its most restricted
  population genetic sense, is possible. Several case studies have demonstrated
  that divergence has occurred in nature without geographic barriers to gene
  flow. Obviously, different sets of criteria for sympatric speciation will
  lead to different numbers of qualifying cases. But changing the rules of
  nomenclature to make â€˜sympatric speciationâ€™ more or less common does not
  constitute scientific progress. Advances in the study of speciation have come
  from studies of the processes that constrain or promote divergence, and how
  they are affected by geography.%

  A major issue in evolutionary biology is explaining patterns of
  differentiation observed in population genomic data, as divergence can be due
  to both direct selection on a locus and genetic hitchhiking. â€œDivergence
  hitchhikingâ€ ({DH}) theory postulates that divergent selection on a locus
  reduces gene flow at physically linked sites, facilitating the formation of
  localized clusters of tightly linked, diverged loci. â€œGenome hitchhikingâ€
  ({GH}) theory emphasizes genome-wide effects of divergent selection. Past
  theoretical investigations of {DH} and {GH} focused on static snapshots of
  divergence. Here, we used simulations assessing a variety of strengths of
  selection, migration rates, population sizes, and mutation rates to
  investigate the relative importance of direct selection, {GH}, and {DH} in
  facilitating the dynamic buildup of genomic divergence as speciation proceeds
  through time. When divergently selected mutations were limiting, {GH}
  promoted divergence, but {DH} had little measurable effect. When populations
  were small and divergently selected mutations were common, {DH} enhanced the
  accumulation of weakly selected mutations, but this contributed little to
  reproductive isolation. In general, {GH} promoted reproductive isolation by
  reducing effective migration rates below that due to direct selection alone,
  and was important for genome-wide â€œcongealingâ€ or â€œcouplingâ€ of
  differentiation ({FST}) across loci as speciation progressed.%

  We formulate a microscopic (individual-based and spatially explicit)
  ecological model to assess whether key patterns of community structure,

  relaxing the mean-field approximation made in classical ecological models. In
  this model of community dynamics species compete both locally in physical
  space and along a niche axis and it includes just two free parameters, Ïƒ,
  controlling the extent of competition in niche space, and t, the simulation
  time. This minimalistic model (1) reproduces with considerable accuracy the
  dynamic sequence of relative species abundances, biodiversity indices and
  speciesâ€“area relationships that are empirically found in censuses of trees
  in a well-studied tropical forest; (2) shows that the clumpy pattern of
  niches leading to long-lasting species coexistence obtained by classical
  competition models is robust to relaxing the mean-field assumption.
  Nevertheless species that are clumped in niche space are simultaneously
  spatially segregated.%

  A classical view of speciation is that reproductive isolation arises as a
  by-product of genetic divergence. Here, individual-based simulations are used
  to evaluate whether the mechanisms implied by this view may result in rapid
  speciation if the only source of genetic divergence are mutation and random
  genetic drift. Distinctive features of the simulations are the consideration
  of the complete process of speciation (from initiation until completion), and
  of a large number of loci, which was only one order of magnitude smaller than
  that of bacteria. It is demonstrated that rapid speciation on the time-scale
  of hundreds of generations is plausible without the need for extreme founder
  events, complete geographic isolation, the existence of distinct adaptive
  peaks or selection for local adaptation. The plausibility of speciation is
  enhanced by population subdivision. Simultaneous emergence of more than two
  new species from a subdivided population is highly probable. Numerical
  examples relevant to the theory of centrifugal speciation and to the
  conjectures about the fate of 'ring species' and 'sexual continuums' are
  presented.%

  Abstract Theoretical studies of speciation have been dominated by numerical
  simulations aiming to demonstrate that speciation in a certain scenario may
  occur. What is needed now is a shift in focus to identifying more general
  rules and patterns in the dynamics of speciation. The crucial step in
  achieving this goal is the development of simple and general dynamical models
  that can be studied not only numerically but analytically as well. I review
  some of the existing analytical results on speciation. I first show why the
  classical theories of speciation by peak shifts across adaptive valleys
  driven by random genetic drift run into trouble (and into what kind of
  trouble). Then I describe the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller ({BDM}) model of
  speciation that does not require overcoming selection. I describe exactly how
  the probability of speciation, the average waiting time to speciation, and
  the average duration of speciation depend on the mutation and migration
  rates, population size, and selection for local adaptation. The {BDM} model
  postulates a rather specific genetic architecture of reproductive isolation.
  I then show exactly why the genetic architecture required by the {BDM} model
  should be common in general. Next I consider the multilocus generalizations
  of the {BDM} model again concentrating on the qualitative characteristics of
  speciation such as the average waiting time to speciation and the average
  duration of speciation. Finally, I consider two models of sympatric
  speciation in which the conditions for sympatric speciation were found
  analytically. A number of important conclusions have emerged from analytical
  studies. Unless the population size is small and the adaptive valley is
  shallow, the waiting time to a stochastic transition between the adaptive
  peaks is extremely long. However, if transition does happen, it is very
  quick. Speciation can occur by mutation and random drift alone with no
  contribution from selection as different populations accumulate incompatible
  genes. The importance of mutations and drift in speciation is augmented by
  the general structure of adaptive landscapes. Speciation can be understood as
  the divergence along nearly neutral networks and holey adaptive landscapes
  (driven by mutation, drift, and selection for adaptation to a local biotic
  and/or abiotic environment) accompanied by the accumulation of reproductive
  isolation as a by-product. The waiting time to speciation driven by mutation
  and drift is typically very long. Selection for local adaptation (either
  acting directly on the loci underlying reproductive isolation via their
  pleiotropic effects or acting indirectly via establishing a genetic barrier
  to gene flow) can significantly decrease the waiting time to speciation. In
  the parapatric case the average actual duration of speciation is much shorter
  than the average waiting time to speciation. Speciation is expected to be
  triggered by changes in the environment. Once genetic changes underlying
  speciation start, they go to completion very rapidly. Sympatric speciation is
  possible if disruptive selection and/or assortativeness in mating are strong
  enough. Sympatric speciation is promoted if costs of being choosy are small
  (or absent) and if linkage between the loci experiencing disruptive selection
  and those controlling assortative mating is strong.%

  Geographic variation may ultimately lead to the splitting of a subdivided
  population into reproductively isolated units in spite of migration. Here, we
  consider how the waiting time until the first split and its location depend
  on different evolutionary factors including mutation, migration, random
  genetic drift, genetic architecture, and the geometric structure of the
  habitat. We perform large-scale, individual-based simulations using a simple
  model of reproductive isolation based on a classical view that reproductive
  isolation evolves as a by-product of genetic divergence. We show that rapid
  parapatric speciation on the time scale of a few hundred to a few thousand
  generations is plausible even when neighboring subpopulations exchange
  several individuals each generation. Divergent selection for local adaptation
  is not required for rapid speciation. Our results substantiates the claims
  that species with smaller range sizes (which are characterized by smaller
  local densities and reduced dispersal ability) should have higher speciation
  rates. If mutation rate is small, local abundances are low, or substantial
  genetic changes are required for reproductive isolation, then central
  populations should be the place where most splits take place. With high
  mutation rates, high local densities, or with moderate genetic changes
  sufficient for reproductive isolation, speciation events are expected to
  involve mainly peripheral populations.%

  Long distance sexual communication in moths has fascinated biologists because
  of the complex, precise female pheromone signals and the extreme sensitivity
  of males to specific pheromone molecules. Progress has been made in
  identifying some genes involved in female pheromone production and in male
  response. However, we have lacked information on the genetic changes involved
  in evolutionary diversification of these mate-finding mechanisms that is
  critical to understanding speciation in moths and other taxa. We used a
  combined quantitative trait locus ({QTL}) and candidate gene approach to
  determine the genetic architecture of sexual isolation in males of two
  congeneric moths, Heliothis subflexa and Heliothis virescens. We report
  behavioral and neurophysiological evidence that differential male responses
  to three female-produced chemicals (Z9-14:Ald, Z9-16:Ald, Z11-16:{OAc}) that
  maintain sexual isolation of these species are all controlled by a single
  {QTL} containing at least four odorant receptor genes. It is not surprising
  that pheromone receptor differences could control H. subflexa and H.
  virescens responses to Z9-16:Ald and Z9-14:Ald, respectively. However,
  central rather than peripheral level control over the positive and negative
  responses of H. subflexa and H. virescens to Z11-16:{OAc} had been expected.
  Tight linkage of these receptor genes indicates that mutations altering male
  response to complex blends could be maintained in linkage disequilibrium and
  could affect the speciation process. Other candidate genes such as those
  coding for pheromone binding proteins did not map to this {QTL}, but there
  was some genetic evidence of a {QTL} for response to Z11-16:{OH} associated
  with a sensory neuron membrane protein gene.%

  Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual
  based models, {IBM}) or agents (agent-based models, {ABM}) have become a
  widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines
  dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there
  is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make
  them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed
  standard protocol, {ODD}, for describing {IBMs} and {ABMs}, developed and
  tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This
  protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details),
  which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and
  scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization,
  Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described
  in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use.
  In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider
  {ODD} as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the
  description of {IBMs} and {ABMs}. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully
  evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.%

  Twelve papers featured in a special issue on individual-based modelling in
  ecology are reviewed in an effort to identify common methodological and
  theoretical issues. The review focuses on issues related to the question of
  whether and how individual-based modelling is changing ecological theory. One
  major hindrance impeding the generation of theory from individual-based
  models ({IBMs}) is the fact that {IBMs} are more or less complex computer
  simulation models. They are thus hard to develop, hard to communicate, and
  hard to analyse. Solving this problem requires both software tools which help
  to implement and communicate {IBMs} and at least the same effort in analysing
  the models as is currently put into their development. A new field of
  application of {IBMs} is Virtual Ecology, i.e. the comparison of simulated
  data sets with those obtained by virtual (i.e. simulated) ecologists. This
  method allows field methods, empirical measures and sampling protocols to be
  optimised. As far as theoretical issues are concerned, individual variability
  was by far the most important issue discussed in the papers. Previously most
  studies concentrated on the mechanisms generating individual variability, but
  there is now also a growing number of models addressing the consequences of
  individual variability for population and community dynamics. In order to
  determine these consequences, a currency is required which allows the model
  populations to be evaluated. Persistence and other stability properties are
  proposed as such a unifying currency. The lesson contained in our review is
  that even with just twelve papers more or less explicitly oriented towards
  ecological theory, elements of a theory that might emerge from
  individual-based modelling in the future can already be identified.%

  Agent-based complex systems are dynamic networks of many interacting agents;
  examples include ecosystems, financial markets, and cities. The search for
  general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often
  uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based
  models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up
  models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling
  have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling.
  This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal
  organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying
  algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system
  complexity.%

  The â€˜{ODD}â€™ (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol was
  published in 2006 to standardize the published descriptions of
  individual-based and agent-based models ({ABMs}). The primary objectives of
  {ODD} are to make model descriptions more understandable and complete,
  thereby making {ABMs} less subject to criticism for being irreproducible. We
  have systematically evaluated existing uses of the {ODD} protocol and
  identified, as expected, parts of {ODD} needing improvement and
  clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of {ODD} to clarify
  aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization
  of {ABM} descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in {ODD} but
  also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: {ODD} improves the rigorous
  formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large
  models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for {ABMs}, it can
  help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general
  objections against such models.%

  The potential of ecological models for supporting environmental decision
  making is increasingly acknowledged. However, it often remains unclear
  whether a model is realistic and reliable enough. Good practice for
  developing and testing ecological models has not yet been established.
  Therefore, {TRACE}, a general framework for documenting a model's rationale,
  design, and testing was recently suggested. Originally {TRACE} was aimed at
  documenting good modelling practice. However, the word â€˜documentationâ€™
  does not convey {TRACE}'s urgency. Therefore, we re-define {TRACE} as a tool
  for planning, performing, and documenting good modelling practice. {TRACE}
  documents should provide convincing evidence that a model was thoughtfully
  designed, correctly implemented, thoroughly tested, well understood, and
  appropriately used for its intended purpose. {TRACE} documents link the
  science underlying a model to its application, thereby also linking modellers
  and model users, for example stakeholders, decision makers, and developers of
  policies. We report on first experiences in producing {TRACE} documents. We
  found that the original idea underlying {TRACE} was valid, but to make its
  use more coherent and efficient, an update of its structure and more specific
  guidance for its use are needed. The updated {TRACE} format follows the
  recently developed framework of model â€˜evaludationâ€™: the entire process
  of establishing model quality and credibility throughout all stages of model
  development, analysis, and application. {TRACE} thus becomes a tool for
  planning, documenting, and assessing model evaludation, which includes
  understanding the rationale behind a model and its envisaged use. We
  introduce the new structure and revised terminology of {TRACE} and provide
  examples.%

  Competition between random genetic drift and natural selection play a central
  role in evolution: Whereas nonbeneficial mutations often prevail in small
  populations by chance, mutations that sweep through large populations
  typically confer a selective advantage. Here, however, we observe chance
  effects during range expansions that dramatically alter the gene pool even in
  large microbial populations. Initially well mixed populations of two
  fluorescently labeled strains of Escherichia coli develop well defined,
  sector-like regions with fractal boundaries in expanding colonies. The
  formation of these regions is driven by random fluctuations that originate in
  a thin band of pioneers at the expanding frontier. A comparison of bacterial
  and yeast colonies (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) suggests that this large-scale
  genetic sectoring is a generic phenomenon that may provide a detectable
  footprint of past range expansions.%

  Analysis of the spatial genetic structure within continuous populations in
  their natural habitat can reveal acting evolutionary processes. Spatial
  autocorrelation statistics are often used for this purpose, but their
  relationships with population genetics models have not been thoroughly
  established. Moreover, it has been argued that the dependency of these
  statistics on variation in mutation rates among loci strongly limits their
  interest for inferential purposes. In the context of an isolation by distance
  process, we describe relationships between a descriptor of the spatial
  genetic structure used in empirical studies, Moran's I statistic and
  population genetics parameters. In particular, we point out that, when
  Moran's I statistic is used to describe correlation in allele frequencies at
  the individual level, it provides an estimator of Wright's coefficient of
  relationship. We also show that the latter parameter, as a descriptor of
  genetic structure, is not influenced by selfing rate or ploidy level. Under
  specific finite population models, numerical simulations show that values of
  Moran's I statistic can be predicted from analytical theory. These
  simulations are also used to estimate the time taken to approach a structure
  at equilibrium. Finally, we discuss the conditions under which spatial
  autocorrelation statistics are little influenced by variation in mutation
  rates, so that they could be used to estimate gene dispersal parameters.%

  We analyze the joint evolution of an ecological character and of dispersal
  distance in asexual and sexual populations inhabiting an environmental
  gradient. Several interesting phenomena resulting from the evolutionary
  interplay of these characters are revealed. First, asexual and sexual
  populations exhibit two analogous evolutionary regimes, in which either
  speciation in the ecological character occurs in conjunction with evolution
  of short-range dispersal, or dispersal distance remains high and speciation
  does not occur. Second, transitions between these two regimes qualitatively
  differ between asexual and sexual populations, with the former showing
  speciation with long-range dispersal and the latter showing no speciation
  with short-range dispersal. Third, a phenotypic gradient following the
  environmental gradient occurs only in the last case, i.e., for non-speciating
  sexual populations evolving towards short-range dispersal. Fourth, the
  transition between the evolutionary regimes of long-range dispersal with no
  speciation and short-range dispersal with speciation is typically abrupt,
  mediated by a positive feedback between incipient speciation and the
  evolution of short-range dispersal. Fifth, even though the model of sexual
  evolution analyzed here does not permit assortative mating preferences,
  speciation occurs for a surprisingly wide range of conditions. This
  illustrates that dispersal evolution is a powerful alternative to preference
  evolution in enabling spatially distributed sexual populations to respond to
  frequency-dependent disruptive selection.%

  The following techniques for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are briefly

  discussions of the following topics: (i) properties of random, stratified and
  Latin hypercube sampling, (ii) comparisons of random and Latin hypercube
  sampling, (iii) operations involving Latin hypercube sampling (i.e.
  correlation control, reweighting of samples to incorporate changed
  distributions, replicated sampling to test reproducibility of results), (iv)
  uncertainty analysis (i.e. cumulative distribution functions, complementary
  cumulative distribution functions, box plots), (v) sensitivity analysis (i.e.
  scatterplots, regression analysis, correlation analysis, rank

  The genetic effects of pleistocene ice ages are approached by deduction from
  paleoenvironmental information, by induction from the genetic structure of
  populations and species, and by their combination to infer likely
  consequences. (1) Recent palaeoclimatic information indicate rapid global
  reversals and changes in ranges of species which would involve elimination
  with spreading from the edge. Leading edge colonization during a rapid
  expansion would be leptokurtic and lead to homozygosity and spatial
  assortment of genomes. In Europe and North America, ice age contractions were
  into southern refugia, which would promote genome reorganization. (2) The
  present day genetic structure of species shows frequent geographic
  subdivision, with parapatric genomes, hybrid zones and suture zones. A survey
  of recent {DNA} phylogeographic information supports and extends earlier
  work. (3) The grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus is used to illustrate such
  data and processes. Its range in Europe is divided on {DNA} sequences into
  five parapatric races, with southern genomes showing greater haplotype
  diversity - probably due to southern mountain blocks acting as refugia and
  northern expansion reducing diversity. (4) Comparison with other recent
  studies shows a concordance of such phylogeographic data over pleistocene
  time scales. (5) The role that ice age range changes may have played in
  changing adaptations is explored, including the limits of range, rapid change
  in new invasions and refugial differentiation in a variety of organisms. (6)
  The effects of these events in causing divergence and speciation are explored
  using Chorthippus as a paradigm. Repeated contraction and expansion would
  accumulate genome differences and adaptations, protected from mixing by
  hybrid zones, and such a composite mode of speciation could apply to many
  organisms.%

  We compare the behavior of the genetic distance between individuals in
  evolving populations for three stochastic models. In the first model
  reproduction is asexual and the distribution of genetic distances reflects
  the genealogical tree of the population. This distribution fluctuates greatly
  in time, even for very large populations. In the second model reproduction is
  sexual with random mating allowed between any pair of individuals. In this
  case, the population becomes homogeneous and the genetic distance between
  pairs of individuals has small fluctuations which vanish in the limit of an
  infinitely large population. In the third model reproduction is still sexual
  but instead of random mating, mating only occurs between individuals which
  are genetically similar to each other. In that case, the population splits
  spontaneously into species which are in reproductive isolation from one
  another and one observes a steady state with a continual appearance and
  extinction of species in the population. We discuss this model in relation to
  the biological theory of speciation and isolating mechanisms. We also point
  out similarities between these three models of evolving populations and the
  theory of disordered systems in physics.%

  Author Summary A commonly held view in evolutionary biology is that new
  species form in response to environmental factors, such as habitat
  differences or barriers to individual movements that sever a population. We
  have developed a computer model, called {EvoSpace}, that illustrates how new
  species can emerge when a species range becomes very large compared with the
  dispersal distances of its individuals. This situation has been called
  isolation-by-distance because remote parts of the range can take different
  evolutionary paths even though there is no particular place where we would
  expect different populations to separate. When the extent of genetic
  difference between individuals is coupled with decreasing offspring viability
  (e.g., resulting from developmental problems), {EvoSpace} predicts that sharp
  spatial boundaries can emerge in arbitrary locations, separating
  subpopulations that occasionally persist long enough to become reproductively
  incompatible species. The model shows an inherent tendency toward spatial
  self-organization, in contrast with the traditional view of environmentally
  forced origins of new species. We think that isolation-by-distance is a
  common aspect of the evolutionary process and that spatial self-organization
  of gene pools may often facilitate the evolution of new species.%

  Fascinating new data, revealed through gene sequencing, comparative genomics,
  and genetic engineering, precisely establish which genes are involved in mate
  choice and mating activityâ€”behaviors that are surprisingly understudied
  from a genetic perspective. Discussed here are some of the recently
  identified visual and chemosensory genes that are involved in mate choice and
  mating behavior. These genesâ€™ products are involved in the production,
  transmission, and receipt of crucial sensory mate-choice cues that affect
  fitness. This review exposes newfound evidence that alternative splicing,
  gene-expression pattern changes, and molecular genetic variation in sensory
  genes are crucial for both intra- and interspecific mate choice and mating
  success. Many sensory genes have arisen through gene duplications, and data
  amassed from studies conducted at scales ranging from individual genes to
  genomic comparisons show that strong, positive Darwinian selection acts on
  several mating-related genes and that these genes evolve rapidly.%

  Abstract The spatial distribution of genetic markers can be useful both in
  estimating patterns of gene flow and in reconstructing biogeographic history,
  particularly when gene genealogies can be estimated. Genealogies based on
  nonrecombining genetic units such as mitochondrial and chloroplast {DNA}
  often consist of geographically separated clades that come into contact in
  narrow regions. Such phylogeographic breaks are usually assumed to be the
  result of long-term barriers to gene flow. Here I show that deep
  phylogeographic breaks can form within a continuously distributed species
  even when there are no barriers to gene flow. The likelihood of observing
  phylogeographic breaks increases as the average individual dispersal distance
  and population size decrease. Those molecular markers that are most likely to
  show evidence of real geographic barriers are also most likely to show
  phylogeographic breaks that formed without any barrier to gene flow. These
  results might provide an explanation as to why some species, such as the
  greenish warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides), have phylogeographic breaks in
  mitochondrial or chloroplast {DNA} that do not coincide with sudden changes
  in other traits.%

  Abstract.â€” Divergence of mating signals can occur rapidly and be of prime
  importance in causing reproductive isolation and speciation. A ring species,
  in which two reproductively isolated taxa are connected by a chain of
  intergrading populations, provides a rare opportunity to use spatial
  variation to reconstruct the history of divergence. I use geographic
  variation in the song of a likely ring species, the greenish warbler
  (Phylloscopus trochiloides) to reconstruct the microevolutionary steps that
  occurred during divergence of a trait that is often important in speciation
  in birds. Populations of a western Siberian (P. t. viridanus) and an eastern
  Siberian (P. t. plumbeitarsus) form of the greenish warbler meet, but do not
  interbreed in central Siberia; these forms are connected by a chain of
  interbreeding populations extending in a ring to the south around the
  treeless Tibetan Plateau. I show that: (1) song structure differs greatly
  between the two Siberian forms, which share the same habitat; (2) song
  structure changes gradually around the ring; (3) singing behavior is
  relatively simple in the Himalayas, but becomes increasingly complex to the
  north, both to the west and east of the Tibetan Plateau; and (4) song varies
  along independent axes of complexity in the western and eastern south-north
  clines. By comparing geographic variation in singing behavior and ecological
  variables, I distinguish among possible causes of song divergence, including
  selection based on the acoustic environment, stochastic effects of sexual
  selection, and selection for species recognition. I suggest that parallel
  south-to-north ecological gradients have caused a greater intensity of sexual
  selection on song in northern populations and that the stochastic effects of
  sexual selection have led to divergence in song structure.%

  The evolutionary divergence of a single species into two has never been
  directly observed in nature, primarily because speciation can take a long
  time to occur. A ring species, in which a chain of intergrading populations
  encircles a barrier and the terminal forms coexist without interbreeding,
  provides a situation in which variation in space can be used to infer
  variation in time. Here we reconstruct the pathway to speciation between two
  reproductively isolated forms of greenish warbler (Phylloscopus
  trochiloides). These two taxa do not interbreed in central Siberia but are
  connected by a long chain of intergrading populations encircling the Tibetan
  Plateau to the south. Molecular data and climatic history imply that the
  reproductively isolated taxa came into contact following expansions northward
  around the western and eastern sides of the plateau. Parallel selection
  pressures for increased song complexity during the northward expansions have
  been accompanied by divergence in song structure. Playback experiments show
  that the two Siberian forms do not recognize each other's songs. Our results
  show how gradual divergence in a trait involved in mate choice leads to the
  formation of new species.%

  A demonstration of how small changes can lead to species-level differences is
  provided by ring species, in which two reproductively isolated forms are
  connected by a chain of intermediate populations. We review proposed cases of
  ring species and the insights they provide into speciation. Ring species have
  been viewed both as illustrations of the history of divergence of two species
  from their common ancestor and as demonstrations that speciation can occur in
  spite of gene flow between the diverging forms. Theoretical models predict
  that speciation with gene flow can occur when there is divergent ecological
  selection, and geographical differentiation increases the likelihood of
  speciation. Thus ring species are ideal systems for research into the role of
  both ecological and geographical differentiation in speciation, but few
  examples have been studied in detail. The Greenish warbler is a ring species
  in which two northward expansions around the Tibetan plateau have been
  accompanied by parallel evolution in morphology, ecology, and song length and
  complexity. However, songs have diverged in structure, resulting in a lack of
  recognition where the reproductively isolated forms come into contact in
  Siberia. Our analysis suggests that these differences could have arisen even
  with gene flow, and that parallel rather than divergent ecological changes
  have led to divergence in sexually selected traits and subsequent
  speciation.%

  In almost all ecological and evolutionary research, it is important to assess
  the number of species under study. Cryptic species, which are morphologically
  similar, present a special problem because they need to be identified through
  studies of behavioural or genetic variation. Here we review the important
  factors in the recent discovery of three species and elevation of nine
  previously known taxa to species status within the genus Phylloscopus (Old
  World leaf-warblers) and we examine the case of three morphologically similar
  taxa (inornatus, humei and mandellii) that until recently were considered to
  be members of the single species Phylloscopus inornatus. We have identified
  several locations at which humei and inornatus coexist at high density, and
  the results of playback experiments, observations of interactions, and
  spectrogram analysis of vocalizations at these sites all indicate that there
  are significant behavioural differences and a lack of recognition between
  humei and inornatus. Estimated relationships within the species complex based
  on mitochondrial control region {DNA} sequences show that there is little
  variation within the geographic ranges of either humei or inornatus compared
  with the deep split between the two taxa. These observations support the
  division of humei and inornatus into separate species. The third taxon,
  mandellii, which is geographically separated from both humei and inornatus,
  is behaviourally and genetically more similar to humei. Under the biological
  species concept, it is difficult to determine the species status of
  allopatric taxa. Alternative species concepts, such as the phylogenetic and
  recognition concepts, are more easily applied to allopatric taxa but lead to
  differing conclusions over whether mandellii and humei are separate species.
  This confusion arises from the fact that the two taxa are in an early stage
  of allopatric divergence. The review of other recently designated species
  reveals that song divergence is of primary importance in their designation
  and that song variation, playback experiments and genetic analysis lead to
  similar conclusions regarding species status.%

  Functional connectivity affects demography and gene dynamics in fragmented
  populations. Besides species-specific dispersal ability, the connectivity
  between local populations is affected by the landscape elements encountered
  during dispersal. Documenting these effects is thus a central issue for the
  conservation and management of fragmented populations. In this study, we
  compare the power and accuracy of three methods (partial correlations,
  regressions and Approximate Bayesian Computations) that use genetic distances
  to infer the effect of landscape upon dispersal. We use stochastic
  individual-based simulations of fragmented populations surrounded by
  landscape elements that differ in their permeability to dispersal. The power
  and accuracy of all three methods are good when there is a strong contrast
  between the permeability of different landscape elements. The power and
  accuracy can be further improved by restricting analyses to adjacent pairs of
  populations. Landscape elements that strongly impede dispersal are the
  easiest to identify. However, power and accuracy decrease drastically when
  landscape complexity increases and the contrast between the permeability of
  landscape elements decreases. We provide guidelines for future studies and
  underline the needs to evaluate or develop approaches that are more
  powerful.%

  Isolation by distance ({IBD}) has been a common measure of genetic structure
  among populations and is based on Euclidean distances among populations.
  Whereas {IBD} does not incorporate geographic complexity (e.g. dispersal
  barriers, corridors) that may better predict genetic structure, a new
  approach (landscape genetics) joins landscape ecology with population
  genetics to better model genetic structure. Should {IBD} be set aside or
  should it persist as the most simple model in landscape genetics? We
  evaluated the status of {IBD} by collecting and analyzing results of 240
  {IBD} data sets among diverse taxa and study systems. {IBD} typically
  represented a low proportion of variance in genetic structure (mean r2=0.22)
  in part because many studies included relatively few populations (mean=11).
  The number of populations studied (N) was asymptotically related to {IBD}
  significance; a study with 9 populations has only 50\% probability of
  significance, while one with {\textgreater}23 populations will have 90\%
  probability of significance. Surprisingly, ectothermic animals were
  significantly (p=0.0018) more likely to have significant {IBD} than
  endotherms, which suggests a metabolic basis underlying gene flow rates. We
  also observed marginally significant effects on {IBD} significance for a)
  taxa in general and b) dispersal modes within actively-dispersing endotherms.
  Other factors analyzed (genetic markers, genetic distances, habitats, active
  or passive dispersal, plant growth form) did not significantly affect {IBD},
  likely related to typical N. For multiple reasons we conclude that {IBD}
  should continue as the simplest reference standard against which all other,
  more complex models should be compared in landscape genetics research.%

  Abstract Assortative mating occurs when there is a correlation (positive or
  negative) between male and female phenotypes or genotypes across mated pairs.
  To determine the typical strength and direction of assortative mating in
  animals, we carried out a meta-analysis of published measures of assortative
  mating for a variety of phenotypic and genotypic traits in a diverse set of
  animal taxa. We focused on the strength of assortment within populations,
  excluding reproductively isolated populations and species. We collected 1,116
  published correlations between mated pairs from 254 species (360 unique
  species-trait combinations) in five phyla. The mean correlation between mates
  was 0.28, showing an overall tendency toward positive assortative mating
  within populations. Although 19\% of the correlations were negative,
  simulations suggest that these could represent type I error and that negative
  assortative mating may be rare. We also find significant differences in the
  strength of assortment among major taxonomic groups and among trait
  categories. We discuss various possible reasons for the evolution of
  assortative mating and its implications for speciation.%

  Speciation, despite ongoing gene flow can be studied directly in nature in
  ring species that comprise two reproductively isolated populations connected
  by a chain or ring of intergrading populations. We applied three tiers of
  spatio-temporal analysis (phylogeny/historical biogeography, phylogeography
  and landscape/population genetics) to the data from mitochondrial and nuclear
  genomes of eastern Australian parrots of the Crimson Rosella Platycercus
  elegans complex to understand the history and present genetic structure of
  the ring they have long been considered to form. A ring speciation hypothesis
  does not explain the patterns we have observed in our data (e.g. multiple
  genetic discontinuities, discordance in genotypic and phenotypic assignments
  where terminal differentiates meet). However, we cannot reject that a
  continuous circular distribution has been involved in the group's history or
  indeed that one was formed through secondary contact at the â€˜ring'sâ€™ east
  and west; however, we reject a simple ring-species hypothesis as
  traditionally applied, with secondary contact only at its east. We discuss
  alternative models involving historical allopatry of populations. We suggest
  that population expansion shown by population genetics parameters in one of
  these isolates was accompanied by geographical range expansion, secondary
  contact and hybridization on the eastern and western sides of the ring.
  Pleistocene landscape and sea-level and habitat changes then established the
  birds' current distributions and range disjunctions. Populations now show
  idiosyncratic patterns of selection and drift. We suggest that selection and
  drift now drive evolution in different populations within what has been
  considered the ring.%

  Motoo Kimura, as founder of the neutral theory, is uniquely placed to write
  this book. He first proposed the theory in 1968 to explain the unexpectedly
  high rate of evolutionary change and very large amount of intraspecific
  variability at the molecular level that had been uncovered by new techniques
  in molecular biology. The theory - which asserts that the great majority of
  evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused not by Darwinian
  selection but by random drift of selectively neutral mutants - has caused
  controversy ever since. This book is the first comprehensive treatment of
  this subject and the author synthesises a wealth of material - ranging from a

  Recent theory has suggested that sympatric speciation can occur quite easily
  when individuals that are ecologically similar mate assortatively. Although
  many of these models have assumed that individuals have equal mating success,
  in nature rare phenotypes may often suffer decreased mating success.
  Consequently, assortative mating may often generate stabilizing sexual
  selection. We show that this effect can substantially impede sympatric
  speciation. Our results emphasize the need for data on the strength of the
  stabilizing component of selection generated by mating in natural

  To date, the taxonomic status of circumpolar breeding populations of the
  Herring Gull Larus argentatus, the Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus, and
  the closely related Yellow-legged Gull Larus cachinnans has been based on
  differences or similarities in phenotype, morphology, and feeding and
  premating behavior. To shed some new light on the many taxonomic
  uncertainties surrounding these taxa, we describe the results of a large
  {DNA} study based on comparing the distribution of 209 biallelic markers
  among 109 gulls, representing 11 gull taxa of the Herring Gull assemblage and
  the Common Gull Larus canus. A detailed phylogenetic analysis failed to show
  clustering of individuals into groups representing either geographic origin
  or phenotype. Alternatively, birds were grouped into taxa defined on the
  basis of phenotype and geographic origin or phenotype alone. Genetic analyses
  revealed significantly different genetic distances between all pairs of taxa.
  However, based on these genetic distances, again no consistent phylogenetic
  tree could be constructed. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that
  about 77\% of the total genetic variability among these gulls could be
  explained by within-taxon differences. Only 23\% of the total genetic
  variability was due to genetic differences between taxa, irrespective of
  their species or subspecies status. Although this seems to challenge the
  current taxonomic treatment of the herring gull assemblage, our results are
  too premature and too incomplete to recommend a drastic change.%

  Sexual isolation is a critical form of reproductive isolation in the early
  stages of animal speciation, yet little is known about the genetic basis of
  divergent mate preferences and preference cues in young species. Heliconius
  butterflies, well known for their diversity of wing color patterns, mate
  assortatively as a result of divergence in male preference for wing patterns.
  Here we show that the specific cue used by Heliconius cydno and Heliconius
  pachinus males to recognize conspecific females is the color of patches on
  the wings. In addition, male mate preference segregates with forewing color
  in hybrids, indicating a genetic association between the loci responsible for
  preference and preference cue. Quantitative trait locus mapping places a
  preference locus coincident with the locus that determines forewing color,
  which itself is perfectly linked to the wing patterning candidate gene,
  wingless. Furthermore, yellow-colored males of the polymorphic race H. cydno
  alithea prefer to court yellow females, indicating that wing color and color
  preference are controlled by loci that are located in an inversion or are
  pleiotropic effects of a single locus. Tight genetic associations between
  preference and preference cue, although rare, make divergence and speciation
  particularly likely because the effects of natural and sexual selection on
  one trait are transferred to the other, leading to the coordinated evolution
  of mate recognition. This effect of linkage on divergence is especially
  important in Heliconius because differentiation of wing color patterns in the
  genus has been driven and maintained by natural selection for MÃ¼llerian
  mimicry.%

  Aimâ€‚ The salamander Ensatina eschscholtzii Gray is a classic example of a
  ring species, or a species that has expanded around a central barrier to form
  a secondary contact characterized by species-level divergence. In the
  original formulation of the ring species scenario, an explicit
  biogeographical model was proposed to account for the occurrence of
  intraspecific sympatry between two subspecies in southern California (the
  â€˜southern closureâ€™ model). Here we develop an alternative ring species
  model that is informed by the geomorphological development of the California
  Coast Ranges, and which situates the point of ring closure in the Monterey
  Bay region of central coastal California (the â€˜Monterey closureâ€™ model).
  Our study has two aims. The first is to use phylogenetic methods to evaluate
  the two competing biogeographical models. The second is to describe patterns
  of phylogeographical diversity throughout the range of the Ensatina complex,
  and to compare these patterns with previously published molecular systematic
  data. Locationâ€‚ Western North America, with a focus on the state of
  California, {USA}. Methodsâ€‚ We obtained mitochondrial {DNA} sequence data
  from 385 individuals from 224 populations. A phylogeny was inferred using
  Bayesian techniques, and the geographical distributions of haplotypes and
  clades were mapped. The two biogeographical ring species models were tested
  against our Bayesian topology, including the associated Bayesian 95\%
  credible set of trees. Resultsâ€‚ High levels of phylogeographical diversity
  were revealed, especially in central coastal and northern California. Our
  Bayesian topology contradicts the Monterey closure model; however, 0.08\% of
  the trees in our Bayesian 95\% credible set are consistent with this model.
  In contrast, the classic ring species biogeographical model (the southern
  closure model) is consistent with our Bayesian topology, as were 99.92\% of
  the trees in our 95\% credible set. Main conclusionsâ€‚ Our Bayesian
  phylogenetic analysis most strongly supports the classic ring species model,
  modified to accommodate an improved understanding of the complex
  geomorphological evolution of the California Coast Ranges. In addition, high
  levels of phylogeographical diversity in central and northern California were
  identified, which is consistent with the striking levels of allozymic
  differentiation reported previously from those regions.%

  Computer simulations were used to investigate population conditions under
  which phylogeographic breaks in gene genealogies can be interpreted with
  confidence to infer the existence and location of historical barriers to gene
  flow in continuously distributed, low-dispersal species. We generated
  collections of haplotypic gene trees under a variety of demographic scenarios
  and analyzed them with regard to salient genealogical breaks in their spatial
  patterns. In the first part of the analysis, we estimated the frequency in
  which the spatial location of the deepest phylogeographic break between
  successive pairs of populations along a linear habitat coincided with a
  spatial physical barrier to dispersal. Results confirm previous reports that
  individual gene trees can show â€˜haphazardâ€™ phylogeographic
  discontinuities even in the absence of historical barriers to gene flow. In
  the second part of the analysis, we assessed the probability that pairs of
  gene genealogies from a set of population samples agree upon the location of
  a geographical barrier. Our findings extend earlier reports by demonstrating
  that spatially concordant phylogeographic breaks across independent neutral

  The great tit complex is divided into four groups, each containing several
  subspecies. Even though the groups are known to differ markedly on
  morphological, vocal and behavioural characters, some hybridization occurs in
  the regions where they meet. The great tit has often been referred to as an
  example of a ring species, although this has later been questioned. Here, we
  have studied the genetic structure and phylogenetic relationships of the
  subspecies groups to clarify the evolutionary history of the complex using
  control region sequences of the mitochondrial {DNA}. The subspecies groups
  were found to be monophyletic and clearly distinct in mitochondrial
  haplotypes, and therefore must have had long-independent evolutionary
  histories. This conflicts with the ring species assignment and supports the
  formation of secondary contact zones of previously temporarily isolated
  groups. According to the phylogenetic species concept, all the subspecies
  groups could be considered as separate species, but if the definition of the
  biological species concept is followed, none of the subspecies groups is a
  true species because hybridization still occurs.%

  The joint evolution of female mating preferences and secondary sexual
  characters of males is modeled for polygamous species in which males provide
  only genetic material to the next generation and females have many potential
  mates to choose among. Despite stabilizing natural selection on males,
  various types of mating preferences may create a runaway process in which the
  outcome of phenotypic evolution depends critically on the genetic variation
  parameters and initial conditions of a population. Even in the absence of
  genetic instability, rapid evolution can result from an interaction of
  natural and sexual selection with random genetic drift along lines of
  equilibria. The models elucidate genetic mechanisms that can initiate or

  In general, individuals who survive to reproduce have genotypes that work
  relatively well under local conditions. Migrating or dispersing offspring
  elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness,
  not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a
  population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection,
  imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to
  be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although
  the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated
  environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such
  populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified
  the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns,
  species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by
  emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic
  processes.%

  Under what circumstances speciation in sexually reproducing animals can occur
  without geographical disjunction is still controversial. According to the
  ringâ€“species model, a reproductive barrier may arise through â€˜isolation
  by distanceâ€™ when peripheral populations of a species meet after expanding
  around some uninhabitable barrier. The classical example of this kind of
  speciation is the herring gull (Larus argentatus) complex, with a circumpolar
  distribution in the Northern Hemisphere. Based on mitochondrial {DNA}
  variation among 21 gull taxa, we show that members of this complex
  differentiated largely in allopatry following multiple vicariance and
  longâ€“distanceâ€“colonization events, not primarily through isolation by
  distance. Reproductive isolation evolved more rapidly between some lineages
  than between others, irrespective of their genetic distance. Extant taxa are
  the result of divergent as well as reticulate evolution between two ancestral
  lineages originally separated in a North Atlantic refugium and a continental
  Eurasian refugium, respectively. Continental birds expanded along the entire
  north Eurasian coast and via Beringia into North America. Contrary to the
  ringâ€“species model, we find no genetic evidence for a closure of the
  circumpolar ring through colonization of Europe by North American herring
  gulls. However, closure of the ring in the opposite direction may be
  imminent, with lesser blackâ€“backed gulls about to colonize North America.%

  Sympatric speciation remains controversial. â€˜Sympatryâ€™ originally meant
  â€œin the same geographical areaâ€. Recently, evolutionists have redefined
  â€˜sympatric speciationâ€™ non-spatially to require panmixia (m = 0.5)
  between a pair of demes before onset of reproductive isolation. Although
  panmixia is a suitable starting point in models of speciation, it is not a
  useful definition of sympatry in natural populations, because it becomes
  virtually impossible to find or demonstrate sympatry in nature. The newer,
  non-spatial definition fails to address the classical debate about whether
  natural selection within a geographic overlap regularly causes speciation in
  nature, or whether complete geographic isolation is usually required. We
  therefore propose a more precise spatial definition by incorporating the
  population genetics of dispersal (or â€˜cruising rangeâ€™). Sympatric
  speciation is considerably more likely under this spatial definition than
  under the demic definition, because distance itself has a powerful
  structuring effect, even over small spatial scales comparable to dispersal.
  Ecological adaptation in two-dimensional space often acts as a â€˜magic
  traitâ€™ that causes pleiotropic reductions of gene flow. We provide examples
  from our own research.%

  Historians and philosophers of science agree that Darwin had an understanding
  of species which led to a workable theory of their origins. To Darwin species
  did not differ essentially from â€˜varietiesâ€™ within species, but were
  distinguishable in that they had developed gaps in formerly continuous
  morphological variation. Similar ideas can be defended today after updating
  them with modern population genetics. Why then, in the 1930s and 1940s, did
  Dobzhansky, Mayr and others argue that Darwin failed to understand species
  and speciation? Mayr and Dobzhansky argued that reproductively isolated
  species were more distinct and â€˜realâ€™ than Darwin had proposed. Believing
  species to be inherently cohesive, Mayr inferred that speciation normally
  required geographic isolation, an argument that he believed, incorrectly,
  Darwin had failed to appreciate. Also, before the sociobiology revolution of
  the 1960s and 1970s, biologists often argued that traits beneficial to whole
  populations would spread. Reproductive isolation was thus seen as an adaptive
  trait to prevent disintegration of species. Finally, molecular genetic
  markers did not exist, and so a presumed biological function of species,
  reproductive isolation, seemed to delimit cryptic species better than
  character-based criteria like Darwinâ€™s. Today, abundant genetic markers are
  available and widely used to delimit species, for example using assignment
  tests: genetics has replaced a Darwinian reliance on morphology for detecting
  gaps between species. In the 150th anniversary of The Origin of Species, we
  appear to be returning to more Darwinian views on species, and to a fuller
  appreciation of what Darwin meant.%

  Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local adaptation
  requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure
  populations. This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological
  knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened
  and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have
  investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced
  genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on
  sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most
  population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a
  new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring
  that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape
  genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and
  environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and
  individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and
  conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as
  phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and
  temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the
  current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.%

  The evolution of communication is a fundamental biological problem. The
  genetic control of the signal and its reception must be tightly coadapted,
  especially in inter-individual sexual communication. However, there is very
  little experimental evidence for tight genetic linkage connecting the
  emission of a signal and its reception. We found that a single genomic
  transposon inserted in the desat1 gene of Drosophila melanogaster
  simultaneously affected the emission and the perception of sex-specific
  signals. This mutation greatly decreased the production of unsaturated
  hydrocarbons on the cuticle of mature flies of both sexes. These substances
  represent the sex pheromones necessary for mate discrimination: control males
  could not discriminate the sex of mutant desat1 flies. Moreover, mutant males
  were unable to discriminate the sex pheromones of control flies. Expression
  of desat1 was found in the peripheral tissues that produce and detect sex
  pheromones. Excision of the transposon rescued both the production and
  discrimination phenotypes, but the two effects did not always coincide. This
  indicates that the emission and perception of pheromones are coded by
  different products of the same gene, reflecting the pleiotropic activity of
  desat1.%

  According to current theory, the splitting of a single species into two is
  best observed by a ring of intergrading populations which occupy a
  ring-shaped distribution area and whose terminal populations not only meet
  but overlap and co-occur without or with only little hybridization. The three
  most discussed examples in birds are revisited here. The great tit complex
  (Parus major s. l.) turned out to be an assemblage of four subspecies groups
  forming a secondary ring of population. The herring gull/lesser black-backed
  gull complex (Larus argentatus s. l.) forms a circumpolar circle of
  intergrading populations, but lacks the crucial cornerstone, the geographical
  overlap. The greenish warbler complex (Phylloscopus trochiloides s. l.) is
  close to the ideal ring species, but the ring is not complete and the
  Siberian zone of overlap needs further clarification and characterisation.%

  Neutral models, in which genetic change arises through random variation
  without fitness differences, have proven remarkably successful in describing
  observed patterns of biodiversity, despite the manifest role of selection in
  evolution. Here we investigate the effect of barriers on biodiversity by
  simulating the expansion of a population around a barrier to form a ring
  species, in which the two ends of the population are reproductively isolated
  despite ongoing gene flow around the ring. We compare the spatial and genetic
  properties of a neutral agent-based population model to the greenish
  warblersâ€™ complex, a well-documented example of an actual ring species in
  nature. Our results match the distribution of subspecies, the principal
  components of genetic diversity, and the linear spatialâ€“genetic correlation
  of the observed data, even though selection is expected to be important for
  traits of this species. We find that ring species are often unstable to
  speciation or mixing but can persist for extended times depending on species
  and landscape features. For the greenish warblers, our analysis implies that
  the expanded area near the point of secondary contact is important for
  extending the duration of the ring, and thus, for the opportunity to observe
  this ring species. Nevertheless it also suggests the ring will break up into
  multiple species in 10,000 to 50,000 y. These results imply that simulations
  can be used to accurately describe empirical data for complex
  spatialâ€“genetic traits of an individual species.%

  The various definitions of a species are discussed and a new one is offered,
  viz. a group of populations which replace each other geographically or
  ecologically, and of which the neighbouring ones intergrade or hybridize
  wherever they can, or are potentially capable of doing so where barriers
  exist. The various difficulties in delimiting species are considered, i.e.
  species in the making and individual variation, leading to failure to
  recognise different stages or phases of one species, or to discriminate
  between closely similar forms of different species. There is a discussion on
  geographical variation and in conclusion a scheme is outlined showing the

  This masterly and long-awaited work is a full exposition, synthesis,
  summation, and critical evaluation of the present state of man's knowledge
  about the nature of animal species and of the part they play in the processes
  of evolution. In a series of twenty chapters, Mr. Mayr presents a consecutive
  story, beginning with a description of evolutionary biology and ending with a
  discussion of man as a biological species. Calling attention to unsolved
  problems, and relating the evolutionary subject matter to appropriate
  material from other fields, such as physiology, genetics, and biochemistry,
  the author integrates and interprets existing data. Believing that an
  unequivocal stand is more likely to produce constructive criticism than
  evasion of an issue, he does not hesitate to choose that interpretation of a
  controversial matter which to him seems most consistent with the emerging
  picture of the evolutionary process. Between the terminal points mentioned
  above, Mr. Mayr pursues the narrative through discussions of species concepts
  and their application, morphological species characters and sibling species,
  biological properties of species, isolating mechanisms, hybridization, the
  variation and genetics of populations, storage and protection of genetic
  variation, the unity of the genotype, geographic variation, the polytypic
  species of the taxonomist, the population structure of species, kinds of
  species, multiplication of species, geographic speciation, the genetics of
  speciation, the ecology of speciation, and species and transpecific
  evolution. The volume provides a valuable glossary; and an inclusive
  bibliography greatly extends its range for those who wish to investigate
  special aspects of the material. Animal Species and Evolution is presented as
  a permanent entity. In accordance with the author's feeling that the
  acquisition of new knowledge will require a new statement, rather than an
  emendation of a previous one, no substantive revisions of this volume are
  planned for future printings. Because of the impossibility of experimenting
  with man, and because an understanding of man's biology is indispensable for
  safeguarding his future, emphasis throughout this book is placed on those
  findings from the higher animals which are directly applicable to man. In his
  final chapter on hominids and the various forms of Homo, Mr. Mayr comes to
  the conclusion that, while modem man appears to be just as well adapted for
  survival purposes as were his ancestors, there is much evidence to suggest
  that he is threatened by the loss of his most typically human
  characteristics. It would be within his power to reverse this tendency.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Representative of the international acclaim accorded Ernst Mayr's Animal
  Species and Evolution, published in 1963, is Sir Julian Huxley's description
  of it as "a magistral book... certainly the most important study of evolution
  that has appeared in many years--perhaps since the publication of The Origin
  of Species." In his extraordinary book, Mr. Mayr fully explored, synthesized,
  and evaluated man's knowledge about the nature of animal species and the part
  they play in the process of evolution.Now, in this long-awaited abridged
  edition, Mr. Mayr's definitive work is made available to the interested
  nonspecialist, the college student, and the general reader. The author has
  retained the dominant themes of his original study--themes now more widely
  accepted than they were in 1963: the species is the most important unit of
  evolution; individuals (and not genes) are the targets of natural selection,
  hence the fitness of "a" gene is a nebulous if not misleading concept; and
  the most important genetic phenomena in species are species-specific
  regulatory systems that give species internal cohesion.Each of the twenty
  chapters of the original edition has been revised; six have been extensively
  reworked. Discussions of peripheral subjects and massive citations of the
  literature have been eliminated, but the glossary has been greatly expanded.
  The focal point of the volume is, naturally, the species--a reproductively
  isolated aggregate of interbreeding populations. Presenting an overview of
  evolutionary biology in Chapter 1, Mr. Mayr then considers the nature of
  species, their population structure, their biological interactions, the
  multiplication of species, and their role in evolution.Because of the
  impossibility of experimenting with man and because an understanding of man's
  biology is indispensable for safeguarding his future, emphasis throughout the
  book is placed on those findings from higher animals which are directly
  applicable to man. The last chapter, "Man as a Biological Species," is of
  particular interest to the general reader. Mr. Mayr concludes that while
  modern man appears to be as well adapted for survival purposes as were his
  ancestors, there is much evidence to suggest that he is threatened by the
  loss of his most typically human characteristics.%

  Cryptic species are often hypothesized on the basis of differences in
  courtship signals. These signal differences suggest that mate recognition
  systems, which include both courtship signals and responses to those signals,
  have diverged between genetically isolated populations. Cryptic species are
  therefore thought to represent distinct genetic units, the boundaries of
  which are maintained by premating incompatibilities, specifically by receiver
  preferences for conspecific signals. Laupala cerasina and L. kohalensis are
  sympatric species of swordtail crickets endemic to the big island of Hawaii,
  that are distinguishable by differences in male courtship song. We first
  tested whether groupings hypothesized by acoustic similarity reflect genetic
  groupings, using {AFLP} data to estimate genetic relationships. Second, we
  tested whether genetic boundaries are maintained by female preferences for
  conspecific song characteristics. Phonotaxis trials were used to determine
  the extent of female preferences for conspecific male song. Results generally
  support both hypotheses, but suggest the presence of porous species
  boundaries.%

  {UNLABELLED} {ABSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND} In the mid 20th century, Ernst Mayr and
  Theodosius Dobzhansky championed the significance of circular overlaps or
  ring species as the perfect demonstration of speciation, yet in the over 50
  years since, only a handful of such taxa are known. We developed a
  topographic model to evaluate whether the geographic barriers that favor
  processes leading to ring species are common or rare, and to predict where
  other candidate ring barriers might be found. {RESULTS} Of the 952,147
  geographic barriers identified on the planet, only about 1\% are
  topographically similar to barriers associated with known ring taxa, with
  most of the likely candidates occurring in under-studied parts of the world
  (for example, marine environments, tropical latitudes). Predicted barriers
  separate into two distinct categories: (i) single cohesive barriers
  ({\textless} 50,000 km2), associated with taxa that differentiate at smaller
  spatial scales (salamander: Ensatina eschscholtzii; tree: Acacia karroo); and
  (ii) composite barriers - formed by groups of barriers (each 184,000 to 1.7
  million km2) in close geographic proximity (totaling 1.9 to 2.3 million km2)
  - associated with taxa that differentiate at larger spatial scales (birds:
  Phylloscopus trochiloides and Larus (sp. argentatus and fuscus)). When
  evaluated globally, we find a large number of cohesive barriers that are
  topographically similar to those associated with known ring taxa. Yet,
  compared to cohesive barriers, an order of magnitude fewer composite barriers
  are similar to those that favor ring divergence in species with higher
  dispersal. {CONCLUSIONS} While these findings confirm that the topographic
  conditions that favor evolutionary processes leading to ring speciation are,
  in fact, rare, they also suggest that many understudied natural systems could
  provide valuable demonstrations of continuous divergence towards the
  formation of new species. Distinct advantages of the model are that it (i)
  requires no a priori information on the relative importance of features that
  define barriers, (ii) can be replicated using any kind of continuously
  distributed environmental variable, and (iii) generates spatially explicit
  hypotheses of geographic species formation. The methods developed here -
  combined with study of the geographical ecology and genetics of taxa in their
  environments - should enable recognition of ring species phenomena throughout
  the world.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The traditional view that species are held together through gene flow has
  been challenged by observations that migration is too restricted among
  populations of many species to prevent local divergence. However, only very
  low levels of gene flow are necessary to permit the spread of highly
  advantageous alleles, providing an alternative means by which low-migration
  species might be held together. We re-evaluate these arguments given the
  recent and wide availability of indirect estimates of gene flow. Our
  literature review of {FST} values for a broad range of taxa suggests that
  gene flow in many taxa is considerably greater than suspected from earlier
  studies and often is sufficiently high to homogenize even neutral alleles.
  However, there are numerous species from essentially all organismal groups
  that lack sufficient gene flow to prevent divergence. Crude estimates on the
  strength of selection on phenotypic traits and effect sizes of quantitative
  trait loci ({QTL}) suggest that selection coefficients for leading {QTL}
  underlying phenotypic traits may be high enough to permit their rapid spread
  across populations. Thus, species may evolve collectively at major loci
  through the spread of favourable alleles, while simultaneously
  differentiating at other loci due to drift and local selection.%

  Maynard Smith and Szathmary have posed the problem of demonstrating the

  how the growth rate and typical scale of the unstable perturbations depend on
  the strength and range of competition, mating preference, fecundity and

  "The origin of biological diversity, via the formation of new species, can be
  inextricably linked to adaptation to the ecological environment.
  Specifically, ecological processes are central to the formation of new
  species when barriers to gene flow (reproductive isolation) evolve between
  populations as a result of ecologically-based divergent natural selection.
  This process of "ecological speciation" has seen a large body of particularly
  focused research in the last 10-15 years, and a review and synthesis of the
  theoretical and empirical literature is now timely. The book begins by
  clarifying what ecological speciation is, its alternatives, and the
  predictions that can be used to test for it. It then reviews the three
  components of ecological speciation and discusses the geography and genomic
  basis of the process. A final chapter highlights future research directions,
  describing the approaches and experiments which might be used to conduct that
  future work. The ecological and genetic literature is integrated throughout
  the text with the goal of shedding new insight into the speciation process,
  particularly when the empirical data is then further integrated with
  theory."--pub. desc.%

  The likelihood of speciation in the face of homogenizing gene flow (i.e.
  without complete geographical isolation) is one of the most debated topics in
  evolutionary biology. Demonstrating this phenonemon is hampered by the
  difficulty of isolating the effects of time since population divergence vs.
  gene flow on levels of molecular genetic differentiation. For example, weak
  genetic differentiation between taxa could be due to recent divergence, gene
  flow, or a combination of these factors. Nonetheless, a number of convincing
  examples of speciation with gene flow have recently emerged, owing in part to
  the development of new analytical methods designed to estimate gene flow
  specifically. A recent example of speciation with gene flow in salamanders
  (Niemiller et al. 2008) further advances our understanding of this
  phenonemon, by showing that gene flow between cave and spring salamanders was
  ongoing during speciation, rather than having occurred after a long period of
  allopatric divergence. Future work on the ecological and genetic factors
  reducing gene flow will likely increase our understanding of the conditions
  that faciliate divergence in the face of gene flow.%

  Studies of patterns of differentiation across genomes are accumulating, yet
  integrative work that combines approaches and fully capitalizes on new
  technologies to test explicit hypotheses is still rare. Thus, debates persist
  about the rate, magnitude, and causes of genomic change. This special section
  is devoted to helping resolve these debates. The eight studies contained
  within demonstrate how we can begin to move away from vague metaphors toward
  quantitative and more precise descriptors of patterns of genetic architecture
  and divergence. However, a particular genomic pattern can often arise via
  different combinations of various processes such as selection, gene flow,
  recombination, mutation, genetic drift, and demographic variability. Thus,
  substantial challenges remain in elucidating which evolutionary processes
  generated observed genomic patterns. Nonetheless, the studies in this section
  demonstrate ways forward toward bridging pattern and process, including
  experimental work, genetic mapping, increased knowledge of natural history
  and demography, and comparative studies spanning taxa at different points in
  the speciation continuum. Such collective work will lead to more powerful
  hypothesis testing. Future work can also help better integrate the
  contributions of ecology, genome structure (e.g., inversions and
  translocations), and genetic conflict to genome evolution.%

  Speciation often results from the accumulation of ``complementary genes,''
  i.e., from genes that, while having no deleterious effect within species,
  cause inviability or sterility when brought together with genes from another
  species. Here I model speciation as the accumulation of genic
  incompatibilities between diverging populations. Several results are
  obtained. First, and most important, the number of genic incompatibilities
  between taxa increases much faster than linearly with time. In particular,
  the probability of speciation increases at least as fast as the square of the
  time since separation between two taxa. Second, as Muller realized, all
  hybrid incompatibilities must initially be asymmetric. Third, at loci that
  have diverged between taxa, evolutionarily derived alleles cause hybrid
  problems far more often than ancestral alleles. Last, it is ``easier'' to
  evolve complex hybrid incompatibilities requiring the simultaneous action of
  three or more loci than to evolve simple incompatibilities between pairs of
  genes. These results have several important implications for genetic analyses
  of speciation.%

  Theoretical studies of adaptation have exploded over the past decade. This
  work has been inspired by recent, surprising findings in the experimental
  study of adaptation. For example, morphological evolution sometimes involves
  a modest number of genetic changes, with some individual changes having a
  large effect on the phenotype or fitness. Here I survey the history of
  adaptation theory, focusing on the rise and fall of various views over the
  past century and the reasons for the slow development of a mature theory of
  adaptation. I also discuss the challenges that face contemporary theories of

  A long-standing goal in evolutionary biology is to identify the conditions
  that promote the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation. The
  factors promoting sympatric speciation have been of particular interest, both
  because it is notoriously difficult to prove empirically and because
  theoretical models have generated conflicting results, depending on the
  assumptions made. Here, we analyze the conditions under which selection
  favors the evolution of assortative mating, thereby reducing gene flow
  between sympatric groups, using a general model of selection, which allows
  fitness to be frequency dependent. Our analytical results are based on a
  two-locus diploid model, with one locus altering the trait under selection
  and the other locus controlling the strength of assortment (a
  â€œone-alleleâ€ model). Examining both equilibrium and nonequilibrium
  scenarios, we demonstrate that whenever heterozygotes are less fit, on
  average, than homozygotes at the trait locus, indirect selection for
  assortative mating is generated. While costs of assortative mating hinder the
  evolution of reproductive isolation, they do not prevent it unless they are
  sufficiently great. Assortative mating that arises because individuals mate
  within groups (formed in time or space) is most conducive to the evolution of
  complete assortative mating from random mating. Assortative mating based on
  female preferences is more restrictive, because the resulting sexual
  selection can lead to loss of the trait polymorphism and cause the relative
  fitness of heterozygotes to rise above homozygotes, eliminating the force
  favoring assortment. When assortative mating is already prevalent, however,
  sexual selection can itself cause low heterozygous fitness, promoting the
  evolution of complete reproductive isolation (akin to â€œreinforcementâ€)
  regardless of the form of natural selection.%

  Spatial and stochastic models are often straightforward to simulate but
  difficult to analyze mathematically. Most of the mathematical methods
  available for nonlinear stochastic and spatial models are based on heuristic
  rather than mathematically justified assumptions, so that, e.g., the choice
  of the moment closure can be considered more of an art than a science. In
  this paper, we build on recent developments in specific branch of probability
  theory, Markov evolutions in the space of locally finite configurations, to
  develop a mathematically rigorous and practical framework that we expect to
  be widely applicable for theoretical ecology. In particular, we show how
  spatial moment equations of all orders can be systematically derived from the
  underlying individual-based assumptions. Further, as a new mathematical
  development, we go beyond mean-field theory by discussing how spatial moment
  equations can be perturbatively expanded around the mean-field model. While
  we have suggested such a perturbation expansion in our previous research, the
  present paper gives a rigorous mathematical justification. In addition to
  bringing mathematical rigor, the application of the mathematically
  well-established framework of Markov evolutions allows one to derive
  perturbation expansions in a transparent and systematic manner, which we hope
  will facilitate the application of the methods in theoretical ecology.%

  After an ancestral population splits into two allopatric populations,
  different mutations may fix in each. When pairs of mutations are brought
  together in a hybrid offspring, epistasis may cause reduced fitness. Such
  pairs are known as Bateson2013Dobzhansky2013Muller ({BDM}) incompatibilities.
  A well-known model of {BDM} incompatibility due to Orr suggests that the
  fitness load on hybrids should initially accelerate, and continue to increase
  as the number of potentially incompatible substitutions increases (the
  "snowball effect"). In the gene networks model, which violates a key
  assumption of Orr's model (independence of fixation probabilities), the
  snowball effect often does not occur. Instead, we describe three possible
  dynamics in a constant environment: (1) Stabilizing selection can constrain
  two allopatric populations to remain near-perfectly compatible. (2) Despite
  constancy of environment, punctuated evolution may obtain; populations may
  experience rare adaptations asynchronously, permitting incompatibility. (3)
  Despite stabilizing selection, developmental system drift may permit genetic
  change, allowing two populations to drift in and out of compatibility. We
  reinterpret Orr's model in terms of genetic distance. We extend Orr's model
  to the finite loci case, which can limit incompatibility. Finally, we suggest
  that neutral evolution of gene regulation in nature, to the point of
  speciation, is a distinct possibility.%

  Identification and analysis of ring species are important to our
  understanding of evolution and speciation. We review geographic variation in
  the Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodia) in the context of a ring species, one of
  few known from the highly vagile class Aves. Although 52 subspecies have been
  named, our reassessment of morphological variation across the entire species
  reveals that 25 subspecies are diagnosable throughout the species' range,
  which includes much of the North American continent. We include an analysis
  of plumage variation in M. m. heermanni of coastal California and M. m.
  fallax of the Sonoran Desert and a description of the contact zone between
  these subspecies, which forms the contact points of a ring centred around the
  Sierra Nevada and Mojave Desert. These two subspecies come into contact in a
  narrow hybrid zone, where interbreeding is limited. In addition to
  substantial differences in plumage, songs of these subspecies vary
  concomitantly with differences in the structure of occupied habitat. Females
  tend to exhibit assortative preferences for plumage and song and males
  exhibit assortative recognition (and associated agonistic behaviour) of song.
  Plumage variation across the Song Sparrow varies according to climate and
  habitat, suggesting both geographical and ecological components to the
  species' diversification.%

  The salamander Ensatina eschscholtzii is an example of a ring species in
  which extant intermediate stages of terminal forms have a nearly continuous
  range, offering replicated interactions at several stages of divergence. We
  employ a greatly expanded allozyme database and individual-based analyses to
  separate the effects of divergence time and gene flow to evaluate how gradual
  divergence of populations around the ring contributes to the development of
  reproductive isolation. Despite the high degree of genetic (Dâ‰¤ 0.39) and
  ecomorphological divergence observed in secondary contacts around the ring,
  reproductive isolation or rare hybridization is observed only at the terminus
  of the ring. Instead, in the secondary contacts sampled around the ring,
  hybrids are common and reproductively successful, enabling genetic leakage
  between parental genomes and the potential for genetic merger. Nevertheless,
  genetic admixture is geographically broad ({\textless}100 km) only in
  contacts between ecomorphologically similar populations (within subspecies).
  When divergence is accompanied by alternative patterns of adaptive divergence
  (between subspecies), zones of intergradation are narrower and affect
  populations only locally ({\textgreater}8 km). Diversification and consequent
  genetic interactions in Ensatina reveal a continuum between populations,
  ecological races, and species, where polytypic traits and high genetic
  differentiation are maintained without reproductive isolation.%

  Since Darwin first proposed that new species could arise without geographic
  separation, biologists have debated whether or not divergence occurs in the
  presence of gene exchange. Today we understand that new species can diverge
  while exchanging genes, depending on the strength of disruptive natural
  selection and the factors that affect the linkage relationships of genes
  under disruptive selection. This mode of diversificationâ€”divergence with
  gene flowâ€”includes sympatric speciation, in which gene exchange occurs
  since onset of divergence, and secondary contact following a period of
  geographic isolation, as well as all sorts of situations in which gene flow
  happens intermittently. In recent years, statistical tools have been
  developed that can reveal the action of gene flow during divergence.
  Isolation-with-migration ({IM}) models include parameters for population
  size, time of population separation, and gene exchange, and they have been
  used extensively to estimate levels of gene exchange. A survey of studies
  that have used these models shows that a plurality find little evidence of
  gene flow; however, many report nonzero gene exchange.%

  Individual-based models ({IBMs}) have been improved in quality and
  reliability in recent years with an approach called pattern-oriented
  modelling ({POM}). {POM} proposes guidelines to develop models reproducing
  multiple patterns observed on the field and to test systematically how well
  the {IBMs} reproduce them. {POM} studies used generally traditional methods
  of goodness of fit such as the sum of squares evaluation or ad hoc
  comparisons of fitting errors and variations. Model selection, however, can
  be a rigorous statistical approach based on information theory and
  information criteria such as the Akaike's information criterion ({AIC}) or
  the deviance information criterion ({DIC}). So far, it has not been tried to
  link {POM} to these rigorous techniques. The main problems to achieve that
  are: (a) the difficulty to have likelihood functions for {IBMs}â€™ parameters
  and (b) the possibility to obtain posterior distributions of {IBMs}â€™
  parameters given the patterns to reproduce. In a first part, this paper
  answers problem (a) by proposing and explaining how to calculate a deviance
  measure ({POMDEV}) for models developed in a context of {POM}. And while
  answering the second problem, a second part of the paper proposes an
  information criterion for model selection in a {POM} context (the
  pattern-oriented modelling information criterion: {POMIC}). This criterion
  does not yet have the same theoretical foundation as, e.g., {AIC}, but uses
  formal analogies to the {DIC}. In a third part {POMIC} is tested with a
  modelling exercise. This exercise shows the potential of {POMIC} to use
  multiple patterns for selecting among multiple potential submodels and
  eventually select the most parsimonious and well fitting model version. We
  conclude that {POMIC}, although being a heuristically derived approach, can
  greatly improve the {POM} framework.%

  Many continental sister species are allopatric or parapatric, ecologically
  similar and long separated, of the order of millions of years. Sympatric,
  ecologically differentiated, species, are often even older. This raises the
  question of whether build-up of sympatric diversity generally follows a slow
  process of divergence in allopatry, initially without much ecological change.
  I review patterns of speciation among birds belonging to the continental
  Eurasian Old World leaf warblers (Phylloscopus and Seicercus). I consider
  speciation to be a three-stage process (range expansions, barriers to gene
  flow, reproductive isolation) and ask how ecological factors at each stage
  have contributed to speciation, both among allopatric/parapatric sister
  species and among those lineages that eventually led to currently sympatric
  species. I suggest that time is probably the critical factor that leads to
  reproductive isolation between sympatric species and that a strong connection
  between ecological divergence and reproductive isolation remains to be
  established. Besides reproductive isolation, ecological factors can affect
  range expansions (e.g. habitat tracking) and the formation of barriers (e.g.
  treeless areas are effective barriers for warblers). Ecological factors may
  often limit speciation on continents because range expansions are difficult
  in â€˜ecologically fullâ€™ environments.%

  The great tit (Parus major) has been considered to be the most typical
  example of an avian ring species. The terminal taxa of the ring (major and
  minor sectors) are supposed to be reproductively isolated in a zone of
  secondary contact in the middle Amur valley, Siberia. Our study combines
  molecular markers (cytochrome-b), bioacoustic analyses and morphological
  characters to judge the ring species status of the great tit complex. Despite
  a notable percentage of intermediately coloured birds in the mixed population
  of middle Amur, a lack of mitochondrial introgression between the major and
  minor sectors and a small number of true hybrids among voucher specimens from
  this area suggest at least a partial reproductive barrier between both
  sectors. In contrast, variation of morphological and especially acoustic
  characters along the ring-shaped area and the phylogenetic structure of the
  P.Â major group do not match the ring species concept. Bioacoustic and
  molecular data (cytochrome-b sequences) reveal two large and closely related
  subspecies blocks, the sectors major and bokharensis in the Western
  Palaearctic and central Asia, and the sectors minor and cinereus in the
  Eastern Palaearctic and South-east Asia, respectively. The two western
  sectors diverged only recently (0.5Â Mya) and they were separated from the
  eastern group by Pleistocene events about 1.5Â Mya. Songs from allopatric
  regions of the two subspecies blocks differ distinctly in frequency
  parameters and element composition. In the area of secondary contact, males
  of all phenotypes share the same frequency range of song, close to the range
  of the typical minor song. Hybrids and major males sing mixed repertoires of
  typical major and minor strophe types as well as mixed strophes. In contrast,
  phenotypic minor males display only pure minor strophes. Differences in mate
  choice and mating success based on repertoire size are believed to uphold the
  reproductive barrier between major and minor birds in the area of sympatry.
  Taxonomic consequences suggest three separate species in the Parus major
  complex: Parus major s.s. (including the very closely related bokharensis
  sector), Parus minor and Parus cinereus.Â Â© 2005 The Linnean Society of

  \field{abstract}{%
  The issue of species delimitation has long been confused with that of species
  conceptualization, leading to a half century of controversy concerning both
  the definition of the species category and methods for inferring the
  boundaries and numbers of species. Alternative species concepts agree in
  treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the
  primary defining property of the species category, but they disagree in
  adopting different properties acquired by lineages during the course of
  divergence (e.g., intrinsic reproductive isolation, diagnosability,
  monophyly) as secondary defining properties (secondary species criteria). A
  unified species concept can be achieved by treating existence as a separately
  evolving metapopulation lineage as the only necessary property of species and
  the former secondary species criteria as different lines of evidence
  (operational criteria) relevant to assessing lineage separation. This unified
  concept of species has several consequences for species delimitation,
  including the following: First, the issues of species conceptualization and
  species delimitation are clearly separated; the former secondary species
  criteria are no longer considered relevant to species conceptualization but
  only to species delimitation. Second, all of the properties formerly treated
  as secondary species criteria are relevant to species delimitation to the
  extent that they provide evidence of lineage separation. Third, the presence
  of any one of the properties (if appropriately interpreted) is evidence for
  the existence of a species, though more properties and thus more lines of
  evidence are associated with a higher degree of corroboration. Fourth, and
  perhaps most significantly, a unified species concept shifts emphasis away
  from the traditional species criteria, encouraging biologists to develop new
  methods of species delimitation that are not tied to those properties.%

  Agent-based modeling is a new technique for understanding how the dynamics of
  biological, social, and other complex systems arise from the characteristics
  and behaviors of the agents making up these systems. This innovative textbook
  gives students and scientists the skills to design, implement, and analyze
  agent-based models. It starts with the fundamentals of modeling and provides
  an introduction to {NetLogo}, an easy-to-use, free, and powerful software
  platform. Nine chapters then each introduce an important modeling concept and
  show how to implement it using {NetLogo}. The book goes on to present
  strategies for finding the right level of model complexity and developing
  theory for agent behavior, and for analyzing and learning from models.
  Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling features concise and accessible
  text, numerous examples, and exercises using small but scientific models. The
  emphasis throughout is on analysis--such as software testing, theory
  development, robustness analysis, and understanding full models--and on
  design issues like optimizing model structure and finding good parameter
  values. The first hands-on introduction to agent-based modeling, from
  conceptual design to computer implementation to parameterization and

  The total genetic diversity of a species is a key factor in its persistence
  and conservation. Because realistic sample sizes are far smaller than the
  total population, it is impractical to exhaustively characterize diversity of
  most populations. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of calculating the
  genetic diversity of a spatial population from a sample using genealogical
  models. We trace the history of a population by simulating the locations of
  the ancestors of a particular sample of the population backwards in time. We
  use this method to estimate the genetic diversity of the global population of
  Pseudomonas bacteria. The same results are obtained whether using a global
  sample or a subsample restricted to a particular geographic region
  (California). The results are also validated by comparing additional
  predictions of the model to the data. Furthermore, we use these results to
  show that the level of genetic diversity in a population depends strongly on
  the size of its habitat, much more strongly than does biodiversity as
  measured by the number of species. The strong dependence of diversity on
  habitat area has significant implications for conservation strategies.%

  Global efforts to conserve species have been strongly influenced by the
  heterogeneous distribution of species diversity across the Earth. This is
  manifest in conservation efforts focused on diversity hotspots. The
  conservation of genetic diversity within an individual species is an
  important factor in its survival in the face of environmental changes and
  disease. Here we show that diversity within species is also distributed
  unevenly. Using simple genealogical models, we show that genetic
  distinctiveness has a scale-free power law distribution. This property
  implies that a disproportionate fraction of the diversity is concentrated in
  small sub-populations, even when the population is well-mixed. Small groups
  are of such importance to overall population diversity that even without
  extrinsic perturbations, there are large fluctuations in diversity owing to
  extinctions of these small groups. We also show that diversity can be
  geographically non-uniformâ€”potentially including sharp boundaries between
  distantly related organismsâ€”without extrinsic causes such as barriers to
  gene flow or past migration events. We obtained these results by studying the
  fundamental scaling properties of genealogical trees. Our theoretical results
  agree with field data from global samples of Pseudomonas bacteria. Contrary
  to previous studies, our results imply that diversity loss owing to severe
  extinction events is high, and focusing conservation efforts on highly
  distinctive groups can save much of the diversity.%

  Abstract Adaptive speciation with gene flow via the evolution of assortative
  mating has classically been studied in one of two different scenarios. First,
  speciation can occur if frequency-dependent competition in sympatry induces
  disruptive selection, leading to indirect selection for mating with similar
  phenotypes. Second, if a subpopulation is locally adapted to a specific
  environment, then there is indirect selection against hybridizing with
  maladapted immigrants. While both of these mechanisms have been modeled many
  times, the literature lacks models that allow direct comparisons between
  them. Here we incorporate both frequency-dependent competition and local
  adaptation into a single model and investigate whether and how they interact
  in driving speciation. We report two main results. First, we show that
  individually, the two mechanisms operate under separate conditions, hardly
  influencing each other when one of them alone is sufficient to drive
  speciation. Second, we also find that the two mechanisms can operate
  together, leading to a third speciation mode in which speciation is initiated
  by selection against maladapted migrants but completed by within-deme
  competition in a distinct second phase. While this third mode bears some
  similarity to classical reinforcement, it is considerably faster, and both
  newly formed species go on to coexist in sympatry.%

  Sexual selection theory proposes correlated evolutionary changes in mating
  preferences and secondary sexual characters based on a positive genetic
  correlation between preference and the preferred trait. Empirical work has
  provided support for a genetic covariation between female preference and male
  attractiveness in several taxa. Here, we study parent and offspring visual
  traits in threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. While focusing on
  the proximate basis of mating preferences, we compare the red breeding
  coloration of males, which strongly contributes to female choice, with their
  daughters' red sensitivity measured by optomotor response thresholds. We show
  that the red color expression of fathers correlates well with their
  daughters' red sensitivity. Given that a within-population genetic
  correlation between signal and preference was experimentally confirmed for
  the red coloration in sticklebacks, our results indicate a proximate
  mechanism in terms of perceptual sensitivity being involved in the
  co-evolution of female preferences and male mating signals.%

  Ecological processes are central to the formation of new species when
  barriers to gene flow (reproductive isolation) evolve between populations as
  a result of ecologically-based divergent selection. Although laboratory and
  field studies provide evidence that â€˜ecological speciationâ€™ can occur,
  our understanding of the details of the process is incomplete. Here we review
  ecological speciation by considering its constituent components: an
  ecological source of divergent selection, a form of reproductive isolation,
  and a genetic mechanism linking the two. Sources of divergent selection
  include differences in environment or niche, certain forms of sexual
  selection, and the ecological interaction of populations. We explore the
  evidence for the contribution of each to ecological speciation. Forms of
  reproductive isolation are diverse and we discuss the likelihood that each
  may be involved in ecological speciation. Divergent selection on genes
  affecting ecological traits can be transmitted directly (via pleiotropy) or
  indirectly (via linkage disequilibrium) to genes causing reproductive
  isolation and we explore the consequences of both. Along with these
  components, we also discuss the geography and the genetic basis of ecological
  speciation. Throughout, we provide examples from nature, critically evaluate
  their quality, and highlight areas where more work is required.%

  Formation of partially reproductively isolated ecotypes in the rough
  periwinkle, Littorina saxatilis, may be a case of incipient nonallopatric
  ecological speciation. To better understand the dynamics of ecotype
  formation, its timescale, driving forces and evolutionary consequences, we
  developed a spatially explicit, individual-based model incorporating relevant
  ecological, spatial and mate selection data for Swedish L. saxatilis. We
  explore the impact of bounded hybrid superiority, ecological scenarios and
  mate selection systems on ecotype formation, gene flow and the evolution of
  prezygotic isolation. Our model shows that ecotypes are expected to form
  rapidly in parapatry under conditions applicable to Swedish L. saxatilis and
  may proceed to speciation. However, evolution of nonrandom mating had complex
  behaviour. Ecotype evolution was inhibited by pre-existing mating
  preferences, but facilitated by the evolution of novel preferences. While in
  many scenarios positive assortative mating reduced gene flow between
  ecotypes, in others negative assortative mating arose, preferences were lost
  after ecotype formation, preferences were confined to one ecotype or the
  ancestral ecotype became extinct through sexual selection. Bounded hybrid
  superiority (as observed in nature) enhanced ecotype formation but increased
  gene flow. Our results highlight that ecotype formation and speciation are
  distinct processes: factors that contribute to ecotype formation can be
  detrimental to speciation and vice versa. The complex interactions observed
  between local adaptation and nonrandom mating imply that generalization from
  data is unreliable without quantitative theory for speciation.%

  The role of spontaneous pattern formation, the appearance of inhomogeneities
  that are not directly imposed by external forces, has not been closely
  examined in the context of the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity in
  wild populations. Using individual-based computer simulations, we
  demonstrated that such patterns form in spatially distributed species with
  local demes under disruptive selection. In our model systems, spatial
  patterns of genetic diversity arose and changed over time even in the context
  of a spatially homogenous environment. The spatial distribution and dynamics
  of the fittest genotypes were controlled by the movement of boundaries
  between domains of the different genotypes. The rate of diversity decay was
  dramatically slower than predicted by traditional models. Therefore,
  spontaneous pattern formation may lead to the maintenance of genetic
  diversity of a species in a contiguous habitat, despite reproductive mixing.
  Moreover, the diversity persisted significantly longer in larger habitats and
  habitats with irregular geographical features. Habitat structure was
  intimately linked to the preservation of genetic diversity. Spontaneous
  pattern formation should be considered along with other spatial effects in
  the design of conservation areas. El papel de la formaciÃ³n espontÃ¡nea de
  patrones, la apariencia de inhomogeneidades que no son impuestas directamente
  por fuerzas externas, no se ha examinado detalladamente en el contexto del
  origen y mantenimiento de la diversidad genÃ©tica en poblaciones silvestres.
  Utilizando simulaciones de computadora basadas en individuos, demostramos que
  tales patrones se forman en especies distribuidas espacialmente con demes
  locales bajo selecciÃ³n disruptiva. En nuestros sistemas de modelo, los
  patrones espaciales de diversidad genÃ©tica surgieron y cambiaron a lo largo
  del tiempo aÃºn en el contexto de un ambiente espacialmente homogÃ©neo. La
  distribuciÃ³n espacial y la dinÃ¡mica de los genotipos mÃ¡s aptos fueron
  controlados por el movimiento de lÃ­mites entre los dominios de los genotipos
  diferentes. La tasa de descomposiciÃ³n de diversidad fue dramÃ¡ticamente mÃ¡s
  lenta de lo predicho por modelos tradicionales. Por lo tanto, la formaciÃ³n
  espontÃ¡nea de patrones puede conducir al mantenimiento de la diversidad
  genÃ©tica de una especie en un hÃ¡bitat contiguo, a pesar de la mezcla
  reproductiva. MÃ¡s aÃºn, la diversidad persistiÃ³ significativamente por mÃ¡s
  tiempo en hÃ¡bitats mÃ¡s extensos y en hÃ¡bitats con caracterÃ­sticas
  geogrÃ¡ficas irregulares. La estructura del hÃ¡bitat estuvo Ã­ntimamente
  ligada a la preservaciÃ³n de la diversidad genÃ©tica. La formaciÃ³n del
  patrÃ³n espontÃ¡neo debe ser considerada, junto con otros efectos espaciales,
  en el diseÃ±o de Ã¡reas de conservaciÃ³n.%

  Natural selection commonly drives the origin of species, as Darwin initially
  claimed. Mechanisms of speciation by selection fall into two broad
  categories: ecological and mutation-order. Under ecological speciation,
  divergence is driven by divergent natural selection between environments,
  whereas under mutation-order speciation, divergence occurs when different
  mutations arise and are fixed in separate populations adapting to similar
  selection pressures. Tests of parallel evolution of reproductive isolation,
  trait-based assortative mating, and reproductive isolation by active
  selection have demonstrated that ecological speciation is a common means by
  which new species arise. Evidence for mutation-order speciation by natural
  selection is more limited and has been best documented by instances of
  reproductive isolation resulting from intragenomic conflict. However, we
  still have not identified all aspects of selection, and identifying the
  underlying genes for reproductive isolation remains challenging.%

  We discuss a minimalist model of assortative mating for sexually reproducing
  haploid individuals with two biallelic loci. Assortativeness is introduced in
  the model by preventing mating between individuals whose alleles differ at

  provide a full description of the evolution of the system for the case of
  very large populations. We derive the equations governing the evolution of
  haplotype frequencies and study the equilibrium solutions, stability, and
  speed of convergence to equilibrium. We find a constant of motion which
  allows us to introduce a geometrical construction that makes it

  Recent computational studies have shown that speciation can occur under
  neutral conditions, i.e., when the simulated organisms all have identical
  fitness. These works bear comparison with mathematical studies of clustering
  on neutral landscapes in the context of branching and coalescing random
  walks. Here, we show that sympatric clustering/speciation can occur on a
  neutral landscape whose dimensions specify only the simulated organismsâ€™
  phenotypes. We demonstrate that clustering occurs not only in the case of
  assortative mating, but also in the case of asexual fission; it is not
  observed in the control case of random mating. We find that the population
  size and the number of clusters undergo a second-order non-equilibrium phase
  transition as the maximum mutation size is varied.%

  Speciation with gene flow is greatly facilitated when traits subject to
  divergent selection also contribute to non-random mating. Such traits have
  been called â€˜magic traitsâ€™, which could be interpreted to imply that they
  are rare, special, or unrealistic. Here, we question this assumption by
  illustrating that magic traits can be produced by a variety of mechanisms,
  including ones in which reproductive isolation arises as an automatic
  by-product of adaptive divergence. We also draw upon the theoretical

  Gene flow among populations can enhance local adaptation if it introduces new
  genetic variants available for selection, but strong gene flow can also stall
  adaptation by swamping locally beneficial genes. These outcomes can depend on
  population size, genetic variation, and the environmental context. Gene flow
  patterns may align with geographic distance ({IBD}â€”isolation by distance),
  whereby immigration rates are inversely proportional to the distance between
  populations. Alternatively gene flow may follow patterns of isolation by
  environment ({IBE}), whereby gene flow rates are higher among similar
  environments. Finally, gene flow may be highest among dissimilar environments
  (counter-gradient gene flow), the classic â€œgene-swampingâ€ scenario. Here
  we survey relevant studies to determine the prevalence of each pattern across
  environmental gradients. Of 70 studies, we found evidence of {IBD} in 20.0\%,
  {IBE} in 37.1\%, and both patterns in 37.1\%. In addition, 10.0\% of studies
  exhibited counter-gradient gene flow. In total, 74.3\% showed significant
  {IBE} patterns. This predominant {IBE} pattern of gene flow may have arisen
  directly through natural selection or reflect other adaptive and nonadaptive
  processes leading to nonrandom gene flow. It also precludes gene swamping as
  a widespread phenomenon. Implications for evolutionary processes and
  management under rapidly changing environments (e.g., climate change) are
  discussed.%

  Ecologically mediated selection has increasingly become recognised as an
  important driver of speciation. The correlation between neutral genetic
  differentiation and environmental or phenotypic divergence among populations,
  to which we collectively refer to as isolation-by-ecology ({IBE}), is an
  indicator of ecological speciation. In a meta-analysis framework, we
  determined the strength and commonality of {IBE} in nature. On the basis of
  106 studies, we calculated a mean effect size of {IBE} with and without
  controlling for spatial autocorrelation among populations. Effect sizes were
  0.34 (95\% {CI} 0.24â€“0.42) and 0.26 (95\% {CI} 0.13â€“0.37), respectively,
  indicating that an average of 5\% of the neutral genetic differentiation
  among populations was explained purely by ecological contrast. Importantly,
  spatial autocorrelation reduced {IBE} correlations for environmental
  variables, but not for phenotypes. Through simulation, we showed how the
  influence of isolation-by-distance and spatial autocorrelation of ecological
  variables can result in false positives or underestimated correlations if not
  accounted for in the {IBE} model. Collectively, this meta-analysis showed
  that ecologically induced genetic divergence is pervasive across time-scales
  and taxa, and largely independent of the choice of molecular marker. We
  discuss the importance of these results in the context of adaptation and
  ecological speciation and suggest future research avenues.%

  The genetic coupling hypothesis of signal-preference evolution, whereby the
  same genes control male signal and female preference for that signal, was
  first inspired by the evolution of cricket acoustic communication nearly 50
  years ago. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the genomic location of
  quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) underlying male song and female acoustic
  preference variation in the Hawaiian cricket genus Laupala. We document a
  {QTL} underlying female acoustic preference variation between 2 closely
  related species (Laupala kohalensis and Laupala paranigra). This preference
  {QTL} colocalizes with a song {QTL} identified previously, providing
  compelling evidence for a genomic linkage of the genes underlying these
  traits. We show that both song and preference {QTL} make small to moderate
  contributions to the behavioral difference between species, suggesting that
  divergence in mating behavior among Laupala species is due to the fixation of
  many genes of minor effect. The diversity of acoustic signaling systems in
  crickets exemplifies the evolution of elaborate male displays by sexual
  selection through female choice. Our data reveal genetic conditions that
  would enable functional coordination between song and acoustic preference
  divergence during speciation, resulting in a behaviorally coupled mode of
  signal-preference evolution. Interestingly, Laupala exhibits one of the
  fastest rates of speciation in animals, concomitant with equally rapid
  evolution in sexual signaling behaviors. Genomic linkage may facilitate rapid
  speciation by contributing to genetic correlations between sexual signaling
  behaviors that eventually cause sexual isolation between diverging
  populations.%

  There is abundant geographic variation in both morphology and gene frequency
  in most species. The extent of geographic variation results from a balance of
  forces tending to produce local genetic differentiation and forces tending to
  produce genetic homogeneity. Mutation, genetic drift due to finite population
  size, and natural selection favoring adaptations to local environmental
  conditions will all lead to the genetic differentiation of local populations,
  and the movement of gametes, individuals, and even entire
  populations--collectively called gene flow--will oppose that differentiation.
  Gene flow may either constrain evolution by preventing adaptation to local
  conditions or promote evolution by spreading new genes and combinations of
  genes throughout a species' range. Several methods are available for
  estimating the amount of gene flow. Direct methods monitor ongoing gene flow,
  and indirect methods use spatial distributions of gene frequencies to infer
  past gene flow. Applications of these methods show that species differ widely
  in the gene flow that they experience. Of particular interest are those
  species for which direct methods indicate little current gene flow but
  indirect methods indicate much higher levels of gene flow in the recent past.
  Such species probably have undergone large-scale demographic changes
  relatively frequently.%

  Since Darwin published the â€œOrigin,â€ great progress has been made in our
  understanding of speciation mechanisms. The early investigations by Mayr and
  Dobzhansky linked Darwin's view of speciation by adaptive divergence to the
  evolution of reproductive isolation, and thus provided a framework for
  studying the origin of species. However, major controversies and questions
  remain, including: When is speciation nonecological? Under what conditions
  does geographic isolation constitute a reproductive isolating barrier? and
  How do we estimate the â€œimportanceâ€ of different isolating barriers?
  Here, we address these questions, providing historical background and
  offering some new perspectives. A topic of great recent interest is the role
  of ecology in speciation. â€œEcological speciationâ€ is defined as the case
  in which divergent selection leads to reproductive isolation, with speciation
  under uniform selection, polyploid speciation, and speciation by genetic
  drift defined as â€œnonecological.â€ We review these proposed cases of
  nonecological speciation and conclude that speciation by uniform selection
  and polyploidy normally involve ecological processes. Furthermore, because
  selection can impart reproductive isolation both directly through traits
  under selection and indirectly through pleiotropy and linkage, it is much
  more effective in producing isolation than genetic drift. We thus argue that
  natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation, and given the many ways
  in which stochastic and deterministic factors may interact during divergence,
  we question whether the ecological speciation concept is useful. We also
  suggest that geographic isolation caused by adaptation to different habitats
  plays a major, and largely neglected, role in speciation. We thus provide a
  framework for incorporating geographic isolation into the biological species
  concept ({BSC}) by separating ecological from historical processes that
  govern species distributions, allowing for an estimate of geographic
  isolation based upon genetic differences between taxa. Finally, we suggest
  that the individual and relative contributions of all potential barriers be
  estimated for species pairs that have recently achieved species status under
  the criteria of the {BSC}. Only in this way will it be possible to
  distinguish those barriers that have actually contributed to speciation from
  those that have accumulated after speciation is complete. We conclude that
  ecological adaptation is the major driver of reproductive isolation, and that
  the term â€œbiology of speciation,â€ as proposed by Mayr, remains an
  accurate and useful characterization of the diversity of speciation
  mechanisms.%

  When divergence occurs in the presence of gene flow, there can arise an
  interesting dynamic in which selection against gene flow, at sites associated
  with population-specific adaptations or genetic incompatibilities, can cause
  net gene flow to vary across the genome. Loci linked to sites under selection
  may experience reduced gene flow and may experience genetic bottlenecks by
  the action of nearby selective sweeps. Data from histories such as these may
  be poorly fitted by conventional neutral model approaches to demographic
  inference, which treat all loci as equally subject to forces of genetic drift
  and gene flow. To allow for demographic inference in the face of such
  histories, as well as the identification of loci affected by selection, we
  developed an isolation-with-migration model that explicitly provides for
  variation among genomic regions in migration rates and/or rates of genetic
  drift. The method allows for loci to fall into any of multiple groups, each
  characterized by a different set of parameters, thus relaxing the assumption
  that all loci share the same demography. By grouping loci, the method can be
  applied to data with multiple loci and still have tractable dimensionality
  and statistical power. We studied the performance of the method using
  simulated data, and we applied the method to study the divergence of two
  subspecies of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).%

  Speciation has been a major focus of evolutionary biology research in recent
  years, with many important advances. However, some of the traditional
  organising principles of the subject area no longer provide a satisfactory
  framework, such as the classification of speciation mechanisms by
  geographical context into allopatric, parapatric and sympatry classes.
  Therefore, we have asked where speciation research should be directed in the
  coming years. Here, we present a distillation of questions about the
  mechanisms of speciation, the genetic basis of speciation and the
  relationship between speciation and diversity. Our list of topics is not
  exhaustive; rather we aim to promote discussion on research priorities and on
  the common themes that underlie disparate speciation processes.%

  We use an individual-based simulation model to investigate factors
  influencing progress toward ecological speciation. We find that environmental
  differences can quickly lead to the evolution of substantial reproductive
  barriers between a population colonizing a new environment and the ancestral
  population in the old environment. Natural selection against immigrants and
  hybrids was a major contributor to this isolation, but the evolution of
  sexual preference was also important. Increasing dispersal had both positive
  and negative effects on population size in the new environment and had
  positive effects on natural selection against immigrants and hybrids. Genetic
  divergence at unlinked, neutral genetic markers was low, except when
  environmental differences were large and sexual preference was present. Our
  results highlight the importance of divergent selection and adaptive
  divergence for ecological speciation. At the same time, they reveal several
  interesting nonlinearities in interactions between environmental differences,
  sexual preference, dispersal and population size.%

  We use an individual-based numerical simulation to study the effects of
  phenotypic plasticity on ecological speciation. We find that adaptive
  plasticity evolves readily in the presence of dispersal between populations
  from different ecological environments. This plasticity promotes the
  colonization of new environments but reduces genetic divergence between them.
  We also find that the evolution of plasticity can either enhance or degrade
  the potential for divergent selection to form reproductive barriers. Of
  particular importance here is the timing of plasticity in relation to the
  timing of dispersal. If plasticity is expressed after dispersal, reproductive
  barriers are generally weaker because plasticity allows migrants to be better
  suited for their new environment. If plasticity is expressed before
  dispersal, reproductive barriers are either unaffected or enhanced. Among the
  potential reproductive barriers we considered, natural selection against
  migrants was the most important, primarily because it was the earliest-acting
  barrier. Accordingly, plasticity had a much greater effect on natural
  selection against migrants than on sexual selection against migrants or on
  natural and sexual selection against hybrids. In general, phenotypic
  plasticity can strongly alter the process of ecological speciation and should
  be considered when studying the evolution of reproductive barriers.%

  The study of speciation has become one of the most active areas of
  evolutionary biology, and substantial progress has been made in documenting
  and understanding phenomena ranging from sympatric speciation and
  reinforcement to the evolutionary genetics of postzygotic isolation. This
  progress has been driven largely by empirical results, and most useful
  theoretical work has concentrated on making sense of empirical patterns.
  Given the complexity of speciation, mathematical theory is subordinate to
  verbal theory and generalizations about data. Nevertheless, mathematical
  theory can provide a useful classification of verbal theories; can help
  determine the biological plausibility of verbal theories; can determine
  whether alternative mechanisms of speciation are consistent with empirical
  patterns; and can occasionally provide predictions that go beyond empirical
  generalizations. We discuss recent examples of progress in each of these
  areas.%

  Quantitative genetic models have indicated that sexual selection may lead to
  speciation in isolated populations or to exaggeration of differences in male
  traits along a cline. We argue that where female mate preference and opposing
  natural selection against conspicuous males have produced a stable
  equilibrium in male trait genotype, a reversed female mate preference may
  invade the population, initially assisted by reduced male mortality. The
  consequent linkage disequilibrium may lead to rapid sympatric speciation.
  Assuming a four-locus quantitative male trait and single-locus female
  preference rule and overlapping generations, we present a simulation model
  which indicates that reversal of female mate preference in a single
  individual can lead rapidly to full reproductive isolation in a small
  population. Speciation may be produced by the proposed mechanism in
  allopatry, parapatry or full sympatry. We suggest that differences in mating
  system and its genetic bases may account for some of the differences in
  speciation rates among lineages.%

  Is individual-based modelling really a new approach in ecology? A large part

  Genuine [`]individual-based' models describe a population made up of
  individuals that may differ from one another; they also describe changes in

  Ecological speciation is considered an adaptive response to selection for
  local adaptation. However, besides suitable ecological conditions, the
  process requires assortative mating to protect the nascent species from
  homogenization by gene flow. By means of a simple model, we demonstrate that
  disruptive ecological selection favors the evolution of sexual preferences
  for ornaments that signal local adaptation. Such preferences induce
  assortative mating with respect to ecological characters and enhance the
  strength of disruptive selection. Natural and sexual selection thus work in
  concert to achieve local adaptation and reproductive isolation, even in the
  presence of substantial gene flow. The resulting speciation process ensues
  without the divergence of mating preferences, avoiding problems that have
  plagued previous models of speciation by sexual selection.%

  Taxon-based research in evolution permits the development of a
  multidimensional approach, illustrated here with lessons learned from
  research on salamanders. The clade is widespread and diverse, yet
  sufficiently small that one can keep all of the species in mind. This
  facilitates research from diverse perspectives: systematics and
  phylogenetics, morphology, development, ecology, neurobiology, behavior, and
  physiology. Different avenues of research offer unique perspectives on how a
  relatively old vertebrate clade has diversified. An integrated,
  hierarchically organized, multidimensional program of research on a taxon
  illuminates many general principles and processes. Among these are the nature
  of species and homology, adaptation and adaptive radiations, size and shape
  in relation to issues in organismal integration, ontogeny and development in
  relation to phylogeny, the ubiquity of homoplasy, ecological niche
  conservation, species formation, biodiversity, and conservation.
  Opportunities for future research and threats to the continued existence of
  salamanders are briefly outlined.%

  Acacia karroo Hayne (Mimosoideae; Fabaceae) is a highly polymorphic species,
  ranging in height from 1Â m to more than 30Â m, and with enormous variation
  in the architecture of adults. Some populations of A.Â karroo with different
  morphologies are situated less than 20Â km apart. This species has been
  considered to be a ring species on the basis of allozyme variation. I wished
  to determine whether this was supported by sapling morphology, and by
  chemical and physical defences to herbivory. I raised four phenotypes from
  the restricted area of Zululand (South Africa) in a common garden with
  controls, and with water and nutrient supplementation. I found that each of
  the four phenotypes maintained their differences in spite of nutrient and
  water supplementation. There was no significant genotype by environment
  interaction. I also found that the coastal population was significantly
  larger than another phenotype that grows just 12Â km inland from it,
  suggesting that there might be local adaptation of these genotypes to
  particular soil types. I confirm that A.Â karroo maintains morphological
  differentiation even when there is substantial alteration of water and
  nutrient availability.Â Â© 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Biological

  \field{abstract}{%
  The evolution of novel sexual communication systems is integral to the
  process of speciation, as it discourages gene flow between incipient species.
  Physical linkage between genes underlying maleâ€“female communication (i.e.
  sexual signals and preferences for them) facilitates both rapid and
  coordinated divergence of sexual communication systems between populations
  and reduces recombination in the face of occasional hybridization between
  diverging populations. Despite these ramifications of the genetic
  architecture of sexual communication for sexual selection and speciation, few
  studies have examined this relationship empirically. Previous studies of the
  closely related Hawaiian crickets Laupala paranigra and Laupala kohalensis
  have indirectly suggested that many of the genes underlying the difference in
  pulse rate of male song are physically linked with genes underlying the
  difference in female preference for pulse rate. Using marker-assisted
  introgression, we moved â€˜slow pulse rateâ€™ alleles from L. paranigra at
  five known quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) underlying male pulse rate into
  the â€˜fast pulse rateâ€™ genetic background of L. kohalensis and assessed
  the effect of these loci on female preference. An astounding four out of five
  song {QTL} predicted the preferences of female fourth-generation backcrosses,
  providing direct evidence for the extensive genetic linkage of song and
  preference in one of the fastest diversifying genera currently known.%
